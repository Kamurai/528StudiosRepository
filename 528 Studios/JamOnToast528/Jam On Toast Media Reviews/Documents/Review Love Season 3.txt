Jam On Toast Review:
Love (Season 3)

Format: Live Action
Applicable Settings: Modern
Applicable Genre: Slice of life, Romantic, Drama

Hit or Skip:  Hit!
	We finally get to see a little bit more positivity from Mickey and see how Gus deals with a more promising future.
	
General:
	Fill
	
Aesthetics:  85
	We get a lot of the same characters in different fun situations, and travel around quite a bit.  There a lot less extragavent drama situations the way we've seen the past seasons, but Gus's movie provides some particular interesting scenes as well as the family reunion.
	
Storyline:  90
	For the most part, this season seems to be very much about positivity bleeding into the ladies' lives and the male counterparts seem to be on the rollercoaster this time: despite Gus pursuing his movie.  While their subtle about it, these storylines are really good, but I'm just hoping they set up for more than just seeing what married life is like.
	
Character Development:  90
	This is both great and sad: we see Randy hit rock bottom and bounce up to rock middle.  Gus gets as ambitious with work as he has with his love life, but buckles under the pressue.  Bertie breaks out of character and betters her love life.  The biggest thing is Mickey and Gus realizing what the reality of their relationship and getting married.
	
Compulsion:  88
	I honestly didn't enjoy Gus struggling with the movie as his problem set as its something he create for himself and just didn't think it through.  Part of what makes the show good is dealing with their natural afflictions: being too nice, being an alcholic, being needy.
	
Final Score:  88.25
