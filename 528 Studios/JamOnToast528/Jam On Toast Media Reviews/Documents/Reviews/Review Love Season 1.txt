Jam On Toast Review:
Love (Season 1)

Format: Live Action
Applicable Settings: Modern
Applicable Genre: Slice of life, Romantic, Drama

Hit or Skip:  Hit!
	The show oscillates from sweet to intense.  One of the most bi-polar shows I've ever seen.
	
General:
	This is a show about the ups and down of relationships and personality afflictions.
	
Aesthetics:  90
	While there isn't much big action sequences / spectacles persay, but the show is very well shot.  Jillian Jacobs is super expressive and the drama amongst the characters tends to manifest itself physically though not violently.
	
Storyline:  91
	This is a romantic storyline, and to keep it interesting, the characters have to inflict conflict on themselves which they do wonderfully.  The characters work extremely well together and keep things in a vague enough state that there is always more so the story feels like its moving forward without being close to a resolution.
	
Character Development:  88
	It feels like every scene adds something to the overall character so each episode they start as almost a new character with independent experiences.  This all feels very natural.  What feels less natural, while I understand it, is that the personality issues of the characters sometimes feel like they suddenly and arbitrarily reset to a different character.
	
Compulsion:  88
	The character keep you guessing, the family style interactions are fun and possibly tragic.  Mickey has wonderfully destructive habits that spur the story along and Gus is sweet enough of a character that we get to see him deal with the challenges of this relationship and balancing work.
	
Final Score:  89.25
