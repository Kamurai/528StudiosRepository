Jam On Toast Review:
Star vs the Forces of Evil (Season 2)

Format: Animated
Applicable Genre: Family, Mystery, Sci-Fi/Fantasy

Hit or Skip:  Hit!
	With all the progression in the first season, the second takes a wonderful turn.  

General:
	Putting Ludo in a position of ambiguity , opening up romantic storylines, magical investigations, and universal apocalyptic level events leaves the worst thing about this is its own power creep.
	
Aesthetics:  93
	Same great animation style, same lovable looking and sounding cast of characters with just a little extra thrown in for good measure.
	
Storyline:  97
	Utilizing Star's broken wand to create a proper secondary storyline with Ludo is amazing and leads a lot of good non Star related content.  As strange or poor a character one might consider Ludo, I don't think they could do what they've done and will do with another character.  Not only did the overall story of this season out do the last, but leaves it where the story that follows will have no choice but to be magnificient.
	
Character Development:  94
	I'm just being honest, but because of the developed storylined, the characters seem to go much farther than deeper this time around, and that's absolutely fine.  Plenty of side character development happens and there is still quite a bit of development, if mostly (appropriately) romantic, with Marco and Star.
	
Compulsion:  97
	This is just a good, fun show with plenty of interesting things to show you.  Even if you were tired of Star and Marco from the first season there is so much going on with the other characters that it should be fresh and interesting this time around.
	
Final Score:  95.25
