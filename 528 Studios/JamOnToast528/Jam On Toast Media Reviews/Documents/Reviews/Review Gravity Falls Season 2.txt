Review: Gravity Falls (Season 2)
Format: Animated
Applicable Genre: Family, Mystery, Sci-Fi/Fantasy

Hit or Skip:  Hit!
	As good a villain as Lil' Gideon made, the return of Bill Cypher sets an apocalyptic level of threat.  

General:
	This show has one of the most interesting villains that I've ever found, animated or live action.  The show does an excellent job of building world continuity episodically, crafting a wonderful and deep narrative with fresh episodic content.
	
Aesthetics:  93
	As good as the animation was in the first season, the studio upped its game.  From sock puppets to shape shifters to doppelgangers to little golf ball people to inter-dimensional demons, this season gives a whole new set of weird and wonderful things to animate, plus brings back almost everyone from the first season to be involved in the story.
	
Storyline:  98
	With the reveal of a continual sub-plot in addition to the ongoing plot in the first season, I am overly amazed at the writers for this show.  With the addition of the new characters, the story is brought to a near perfect crescendo at the climax of the season.  With the foggy epilogue and the end of summer at hand, I can only imagine how (/when) they will follow this up.
	
Character Development:  95
	With the exception of Bill's entourage and Mabel's imagination, nearly everyone is as well developed as they were in the first season.  While Mabel's character insists on a failure of this, I want more from Bill and company.  The lack on backstory on what happened in Bill's dimension and what the actual motivations of this crew are is glarinly non-complex compared to the stories we have been given.  The next Season just better be called "Bill Meets World", if you get what I'm saying.
	
Compulsion:  97
	With the introduction of Stanford and the slew of mystical crap happening, especially with Bill, combined with the general cuteness of the show, I don't understand why everyone hasn't watched and enjoyed this at this point.
	
Final Score:  95.75
	Watch, watch and accept Bill Cypher as your lord and master.
