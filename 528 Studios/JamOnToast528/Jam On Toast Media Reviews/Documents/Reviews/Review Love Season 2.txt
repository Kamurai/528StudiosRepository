Jam On Toast Review:
Love (Season 2)

Format: Live Action
Applicable Settings: Modern
Applicable Genre: Slice of life, Romantic, Drama

Hit or Skip:  Hit!
	Just as good as the first season, and even a little self aware.
	
General:
	Jumping off from Mickey's decision to start fixing herself, we're seeing Gus try to maintain / survive romantically and professionally while Mickey struggles internally and deal with her separation anxiety.
	
Aesthetics:  90
	This season is also well shot, with a wide variety of different settings, showing a bigger picture than just our two characters even when its just them.  Even when they're not together, the show does a great job of visually showing how close the characters are, or how emotionally sound the relationship is.
	
Storyline:  90
	With the two characters decidedly together, however amicable, we're sort of taken on this adventure of a united front through / against the world.  Where the first season was "If they can get together" then this season would be "If they can stay together" and with every challenge in the book happening, I'm sure there are few surprises left in the next season.
	
Character Development:  88
	Despite introducing some new characters, the character development happening in this season feels like it is a lot less about individual characters and more about couples: Berti and Randy, Mickey and her dad, Arya's parents, Gus and various work relationships.  While good, it feels that the characters individually take lateral steps.
	
Compulsion:  89
	The characters are fun, and its good to see them sort of stop chasing and combating one another and get on the same page.  Them adventuring as a couple, with or against other couples revitalizes the show in a way I honestly didn't expect.
	
Final Score:  89.25
