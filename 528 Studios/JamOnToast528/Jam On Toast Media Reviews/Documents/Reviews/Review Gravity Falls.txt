Review: Gravity Falls (2 Seasons)
Format: Animated
Applicable Genre: Family, Mystery, Sci-Fi/Fantasy

Hit or Skip:  Hit!
	I don't know if there is another mystery show that I would recommend, much less another animated one.  

General:
	This show has one of the most interesting villains that I've ever found, animated or live action.  The show does an excellent job of building world continuity episodically, crafting a wonderful and deep narrative with fresh episodic content.
