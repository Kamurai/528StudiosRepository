Hi, I'm Rooster and I'm the cat version of a creamsicle: sweet and orange with a little white down the middle.

I can be a little skittish, I am missing an ear from when I was very young, but I love getting my 
head scratched and love being cute and sweet as long as there is nothing scary happening.

I love playing with my sister, CT, but am friendly enough with other cats if they're not scary.
