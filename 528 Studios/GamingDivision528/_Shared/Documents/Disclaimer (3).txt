Gaming Division videos are created with the purpose of entertainment, 
whether it be our own or others', 
and enlightenment through the discussion of intelligent concepts and opinions
 or any random things that come our way.

Anyone who is stupid, disagrees with us, 
and / or simply doesn't like our videos 
are welcome to not favorite, thumb us down ( short stop to look at each other ),
 not subscribe, unsubscribe,
 or WATCH SOMETHING ELSE.  With that said,
 Jam on Toast 5 2 8 will not do the following annoying things:

1)  Ask you to subscribe, thumb or favorite.
2)  Apologize for being late or not making videos.
3)  Claim we do not know what to say or discuss.
4)  Do "thank you"s in formats other than the following:

	a)  Giving credit where credit is due.
	b)  Special response videos, directed to a particular person.
	c)  Commemorative "Thank You" videos, which you are welcome to ignore.

We at Gaming Division do encourage you to comment,
 discuss, respond, and most importantly,
 "Expand your mind.".

Thanks for making the world a better place, and Have a Nice Day!
