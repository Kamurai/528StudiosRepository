Gaming Division Review:
Snake Pass

Platform:	PC, Steam
Applicable Genre:  3D, Puzzle, Platformer

Hit or Skip:  Skip!
	Unless you're a masochist looking for a newt twist on puzzle games.

General:
	This game is an exercise in frustration.  The entire game is a puzzle of how to collecthon nonsense by fighting it's controls.
	
Aesthetics:  80
	It has an admittedly cute style to it.  You can tell by the details that the developers worked very hard on the look of the game.  This is especially noticeable with the water graphics.

Control Interface:  51
	I don't know if I've had such a strenuous use of a control scheme since Grow Up.  The minutia of control needed to achieve some of the goals is bordering on painful.  I'm being honest when I say the game left my hands hurting.

Environmental Controls:  30
	I honestly reached a point in the game where it felt impossible do what was apparently necessary to finish the level.  I only manage to end the level by glitching the weight of the snake from one platform to the next and completely cheating my way up onto the platoform.
	
Game Mechanics:  51
	This is such an innovative idea for a 3d puzzle platformer, that I was initially so impressed that I expect to do no less than love this game.  However, the reality of this game that it is a very well designed monstrousity of an experience.

Storyline: 51
	There is the barest amount of story here, and presenting it drip by drip as you repair the portal chain is actually a good delivery mechanism.  It would be effective if the actual gameplay wasn't such a pain.
	
Final Score:  52.6
	I wanted this to be better.
