Gaming Division Review:
10 Second Ninja

Platform:	PC, Steam
Applicable Genre:  2D, Platformer

Hit or Skip:  Hit!
	Wonderfully crafted precision platformer.

General:
	Because of the small 10 second duration levels that make this game it almost feels like a puzzle as well.  Puzzle it out and then it rates your execution.  I can easily see this as a game played by committee.
	
Aesthetics:  75  
	There is a cute aesthetic to the ninja and the enemy robots, but there is the horrible decision to make them into Nazi robots, and of course Robot Hilter.  Of course, the point is to make them the bad guys and to take shots at Hitler, but it doesn't feel like the effort was worth it.

Control Interface:  85
	The controls seem to be decent enough, unless you accidentally and repeatedly press the restart button when you don't want to.  I personally found the slash and kunai options to be farther apart than I wanted most of tim, but it would be better than being too far from the jump button.

Environmental Controls:  80
	The most awkward thing was the positioning of the slash when the katana activates.  Because it is an instant generation and not a gradual slash away from the body, there was some adjustment to the physics.  Learning how to trigger icicles when I wanted to was a pain.  Otherwise the physics work well and I just had to learn to jump effeciently.
	
Game Mechanics:  95
	For a precision platformer, the levels are extremely well crafted.  Just because I wasn't able to beat them, doesn't mean I don't respect them.  Each game element and enemy are obviously taken into account and only added for specific purpose.

Storyline: 49
	There is some cutscenes inbetween the worlds, where Robot Hitler and its minions have some stupid discussions that just barely fail being a proper story.
	
Final Score:  76.8
	This is good precision platfomer, sutitable for a group setting.
