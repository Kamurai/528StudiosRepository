Gaming Division Review:
Hunie Cam Studios

Platform:	PC, Steam
Applicable Genre:  Management

General:
	I'm not sure what it is about this game, but trying to manage an entertainment company for money AND fans is fairly compelling.  If there is something this franchise knows how to do well (other than thinly veil an adult theme) is it getting you invested in the next thing.  The feel of the game drives you to do the next thing and before you realize it, you don't know where the time has gone.
	
Aesthetics:  85
	Keep it basic: its cute, its simple, its stylized, it has customizable options for the ladies (that you have to earn), adult themes while saying clean and decent.

Control Interface:  92
	The interface is basically everything it needs to be, especially if you consider cross-platform compatibility with mobile gaming.  I would personally like additional controls for PC, but the current control scheme makes sense: I just don't enjoy dragging things back and for itself.

Environmental Controls:  90
	There is not a lot here other than the ingame clock, which works just fine.  And adjustable slider might be an improvement, but as the mechanics adjust collections as the game progresses.

Game Mechanics:  88
	While the mechanics are fun, comical, and generally lend to fun gameplay, they are somewhat limiting, but that is the point: to use them to generate the one objective.  Some games are about doing whatever to meet an objective, this game is about doing everything to do the one thing as well as possible so it tends to mimic a high performance platformer where it is about how close you get to the perfect play rather than enjoying the experience of playing the game.

Storyline: n/a
	With the design of the game, there isn't much of a story except who you hire and how much money and fans you have as a company.
	
Final Score:  88.75
	Its a fun time if you're comfortable enough with the thematic material.
