Gaming Division Review:
Lost Castle

Platform:	PC, Steam
Applicable Genre:  Isometric, top down, brawler

Hit or Skip:  Skip!
	Play Castle Crashers instead.

General:
	This just wasn't a great experience for me.  Pretty much any aspect of the game just reminded me that there are better games out there.
	
Aesthetics:  75
	It's got a cute aesthetic, but it doesn't feel like it matters when the mechanics are distractingly clunky.

Control Interface:  60
	Because of how the weapons are randomize, what the controls are actually doing is confusing.  Without some consistency, the muscle memory is a little harder to build so I found myself missing the action I actually wanted.

Environmental Controls:  51
	The environment functions, but because of the how the 2.5D works it's extremely problematic to gauge incoming fire and if a trap will hurt you.  I found myself not only snagging or get hit by things that weren't obvious, but getting hit by enemies under attack and unable to navigate away to avoid their attacks because I was still swinging.
	
Game Mechanics:  45
	The rogue-like component doesn't add anything to this game, maybe if you took it out, then it would be a lot better.  But that's essentially Castle Crashers.  Repeating through the same unenjoyable gameplay over and over until you're statistically capable of getting through it in a reasonable amount of time isn't a game, it's a chore.

Storyline: n/a
	Not a story game.
	
Final Score:  57.75
