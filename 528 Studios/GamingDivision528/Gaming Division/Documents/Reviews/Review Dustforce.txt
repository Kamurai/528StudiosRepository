Gaming Division Review:
Dustforce

Platform:	PC, Steam
Applicable Genre:  2D, Platformer

Hit or Skip:  Hit!
	Elitist platformers, take on this challenge.

General:
	One can see that Dustforce learned from the same school of thought that MeatBoy did.  It feels heavier, but just as difficult for that reason.
	
Aesthetics:  80
	The stylized asthetic is kind of all over the place, but when it comes down to it: it's about cleaning each level as quickly and thoroughly as possible.  The aesthetics definitely facilitate that and add a friendly and palatable visual.

Control Interface:  70
	The original keyboard controls felt impossible, but remapping them to a Xbox360 controller helped make them feel more natural.  I can't say I approve of how the dash, jump, double jump options work, and I definitely wish there was a triple jump or "power up" ability other than the "super saiyan" / "ka o ken" for which you have to manually gather energy.

Environmental Controls:  60
	This game, is mean to you: it doesn't really allow you to step forward a space, the wall / ceiling / ledge running doesn't feel intuitive, and my instincts to wall jump fought me everywhere I was supposed to wall run.  You absolutely have to learn how the game is going to behave versus how you expect to behave to get anywhere with it.
	
Game Mechanics:  90
	These are amazingly well designed levels.  The level of expected precision is fantastic.  While I don't usually enjoy it when a game is about how little you mess up a perfect play through, I can appreciate how well designed a thing I'll never do is.

Storyline: N/A
	Clean the world?
	
Final Score:  75
	A game for elite platformers giving a reference to the days when video games were meant to be hard.
