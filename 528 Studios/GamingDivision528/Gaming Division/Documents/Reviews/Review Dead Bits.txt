Gaming Division Review:
Dead Bits

Platform:	PC, Steam
Applicable Genre:  1st Person, Shooter

Hit or Skip:  Skip!
	Ugh, this looks and feels like a middle schooler masochist made it.

General:
	There is every chance that I'm just bad at games like this, but it feels like it was made to challenge and, moreso, punish you every step of the way.
	
Aesthetics:  40
	There are 3d voxel models, but they actually look worse than Roblox, the levels aren't really put together in any interesting way, and whatever sounds are in this, I can't hear over myself cursing about what piece of shit it is.

Control Interface:  40
	The controls are good enough, though switching weapons doesn't feel good, nor does it seem worthwhile as its not sensible for the scenarios and takes your hands away from the controls if you need to do it.  There is an auto jump built in to kill you if you like to hold the jump button.

Environmental Controls:  20
	The levels that I played are laid out like scattered pancakes.  You're not warned about lava, and platforms disappear to prevent backtracking even when its a required mechanic.  At least the damage registration is decent.

Game Mechanics:  10
	As simple as "get to the end of the run" should be, this throws ridiculous platforming and precision damage dealing without sufficient checkpoints. I don't think I've seen punishment like this outside of stealth games.

Storyline: n/a
	There is barely a game here let alone a story: though they attempted a premise.
	
Final Score:  27.5
	Play at your own desire for punishment.
