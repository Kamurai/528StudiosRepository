Gaming Division Review:
Overgrowth

Platform:	PC, Steam
Applicable Genre:  3rd Person, Action/Adventure, brawler

Hit or Skip:  Hit!
	Surprisingly fun and funny.

General:
	Ever wanted to be a Kung Fu rabbit person?  This game let's you brawl as one, and its pretty fun.
	
Aesthetics:  80
	It doesn't look great, but we are dealing with human bodies on animal heads, so that's a given.  The textures have a lot of detail put into them, and the scenes are designed well for the look of the scene.  Maybe it was the dialogue, but game feels fun and atmospheric.

Control Interface:  70
	It might have been because I was using a controller, but it felt like I was tripping over my own fingers for the vital controls and my thumb got the weird tasks: other than trying to carry up to 4 1-handed weapons, I'm not sure why you would bother to sheathe a weapon that objectively does more damage than a fist.  It is good that there's a dodge/roll/evade/standup/counter button, but I couldn't tell you which of the two buttons do which out of that list.

Environmental Controls:  80
	The game is a little glitchy here and there, but nothing critical in general.  Unfortunately when you go to jump, you have no control after you leave the ground (as expected) which creates some issues with how you react to walls you touch in the air.  Many of the levels are designed for you to repeatedly fall and fail, though the checkpoints are fairly sufficient.

Game Mechanics:  75
	The dodge and counter system is absolute trash, certain enemies have strong enough, long reaching enough attacks that it doesn't matter if you evade, and the counter system feels like I'm playing roulette so I have to keep restarting until I get lucky.  Some of that is "git good" and some of that is "you made a game I physically have trouble playing".  The rest of it is pretty fun, even when I was outnumbered, and worst case I could "Hulk" jump to my heart's content to get away from combat.

Storyline: 85
	They actually did a decent job with the story, and using it as a reward to pause the action for a few seconds before jumping into the next bit.  Not too long, not too short, they honestly know their pacing very well.
	
Final Score:  78
	Definitely a fun game to have played through, but there are a lot of better games around.
