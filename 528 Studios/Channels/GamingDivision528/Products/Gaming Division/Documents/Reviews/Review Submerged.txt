Gaming Division Review:
Submerged

Platform:	PC, Steam
Applicable Genre:  3D, Exploration, Fetch Quest

Hit or Skip:  Skip!
	While I did finish the game, I find it hard to actually recommend this title.

General:
	The game is fairly short and straight forward and doesn't require that you go everywhere, just that you fetch the necessary items it requests.
	
Aesthetics:  80
	The graphics are fine, not great, but solid.  They are detailed enough to tell what's what, but they're more atmospheric than anything else.  Music is good, but its relaxing more than invigorating.

Control Interface:  85
	The controls are simple, so simple its almost painful.  You move to move, the boat gets a booster that is unnecassarily limited to give you a sense of progression, and you interact with things.  While I yearned to jump and find holes to crawl through, the only real problem with the controls was some nesting issues with calling the map from being in the telescope, vice versa.

Environmental Controls:  75
	The boat handles well, it handles beautifully, I wish any of it lead to anything meaningful.  This whole thing could be replaced with a fast travel component.  The meat of it is that the jump /drop mechanic is somewhat finicky and can cause some frustration or even cause some penalties if it drops you to a place where you can't jump back up.

Game Mechanics:  75
	There....really aren't any.  I'd have paid extra for a sprint button.  That the city is an open world is interesting.  It allows the player to finish each "dungeon" in any order they want, giving some replayability, but the experience is too similar that I can't imagine people really would want that.

Storyline: 80
	There is a wonderful story here, even if we're only getting a chapter of it and it was deus exed a little at the end.  I honestly would like more of it: there are a lot of details to this world I'd like to explore.
	
Final Score:  79
	If a relatively short, silent, exploratory game sounds good to you, then this might be for you.
