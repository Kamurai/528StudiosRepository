Gaming Division Review:
Last Day of June

Platform:	PC, Steam
Applicable Genre:  Visual Novel, Time Travel, Mystery

Hit or Skip:  Hit!
	A wonderful approach to Visual Novels without being a traditional visual novel.

General:
	First, let's be clear: I don't consider this a game.  This is seems to be more of a non traditional visual novel.  Yes there are some collectibles and navigation, but the base of the game comes down to making very specific choices to see how the stroy plays out.
	
Aesthetics:  95
	While you make look at this game's style and wonder, its honestly done at a very high quality. The fact that the game makes you feel like the first 11 minutes of "Up!" for a few hours without any dialogue is absolutely amazing.

Control Interface:  70
	The basic control scheme is fine, it does what it needs to do, and each character has their own "abilities" which helps make it fun.  Thing that irritated me is that there is no way to skip the scenes you see over and over again.  The game made me involved in June's death over and over again, and I really just wish it would do it without me asking it to.
  
Environmental Controls:  85
	The environment feels responsive, there are barred entries to unlock to control the navigation of the story to mirror decision trees in a more traditional visual novel.  Events normally resolve perfectly, but I had one instance where I got trapped on the wrong side of a gate and had to restart.

Game Mechanics:  90
	The time loop makes this great, even when it starts to go off the rails towards the end.  Barring off different sections of the neighborhood helps keep things fresh as we look for clues and unlock the next character and chapter.  It definitely knows how to reward the player with new things to keep our interest.

Storyline: 95
	This story is sad, there is no bones about it, but that it made me feel sad almost the entire time is to its credit.  Its interesting to see a story told in a loop like this, especially when it spins out to one, very short timeline.
	
Final Score:  87
	I challenge you to find another game even similar to this.
