Gaming Division Review:
The Sexy Brutale

Platform:	PC, Steam
Applicable Genre:  Time Travel, Mystery

Hit or Skip:  Hit!
	This is such a unique take on a story driven game.

General:
	Fill
	
Aesthetics:  85
	The game is very stylized, with their big heads and goofy masks.  While not being very graphically intense, the game certainly makes you feel through the music and atmosphere.  There are surprising breaks in the typical view and visual aspects like ghosts that only appear in certain situations, as well as the ability to listen for other characters and conversations.

Control Interface:  88
	The controls remain simple but with some special abilities.  While the controls don't stop the timer for the loop, the map allows some tracking for known informaiton, and the reset clock allows easy reset to certain times.  The controls are basically everything you need except a sprint button without feeling special.  The only real complaint I have is interacting with objects, especially doors with multiple options, can be a little clunky.

Environmental Controls:  90
	The time loop is amazing.  Being able to interrupt it to see what the characters do without being able to permanently disable them is an entire mini-game to itself.  There are some small problems to how and when the doors react, but nothing game breaking and only one rage inducing moment, which was ultimately my fault.

Game Mechanics:  95
	Having the game run on a track isn't necessarily a great thing, but for some reason, putting it on a loop with all the character having their own tracks makes it awesome.  Using the same system for each chapter keeps it familiar, yet cleverly restricts the access by the mask abilities you gain in each chapter.  Binding to the clocks helps navigate around the enormous mansion setting.  The way the investigation works in the game makes for a really special experience.

Storyline: 80
	The game starts out so strong with a great murder mystery plot, actually several murder mystery plots.  The idea of the entire set of guests being murdered during the course of the events is fascinating, moreso because its all on a time loop track that you can interrupt.
	
	Where it falls apart is towards the end of the game where you discover why everyone is dying, and why you have a time loop at all, and how you have to end it.  It just doesn't feel as sastifying as the rest of the game.
	
Final Score:  87.6
	I really want more of this type of game.
