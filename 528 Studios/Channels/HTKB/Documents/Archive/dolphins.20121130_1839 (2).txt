I'm not a religious nut.

I hate how living animals are treated before slaughter, but am not against killing 
of animals with a reason.


There is no dolphin farms, so you're cow analogy is bunk.

The "Cove" workers acknowledge that they should be shut down, and repeatedly hide 
their actions.

dolphin harvesters hide and disguise the meat by masquerading it as fish.

They give it to schools where the people who ingest it are children that are
not finished developing, and this is where the mercury poisoning comes into 
the most effect, altering development.

The entire point of this process is to commit genocide against another species
for eating fish that the japanese 

The hunting of Bison was stopped to prevent their extinction.




Dolphins are near sentient, are able to interpret sign language and limited english.
If you're considering dolphins evil for these human terms, then humans are just as 
if not more evil, and deserve the genocide just as much

Symbol association is a very basic conditioning so the pigs, while fairly smart, don't impress me.

It is this very aspect that allows them to reason about "gang raping" and killing 
of infants for a multitude of reasons.  It could be anything from food, to annoyance, 
to the desire to mate with the mother.

Killing of porpoises is a natural capitalistic act, putting their species and his / her self 
first.




As far as foreign policy goes:

When they live on another planet, affect a different ocean, a different ozone,

and are not leaching any resources from Terra, then they can do whatever they one.


People want to pretend to be civilised, but they only want it as far as it will 
benefit them.
