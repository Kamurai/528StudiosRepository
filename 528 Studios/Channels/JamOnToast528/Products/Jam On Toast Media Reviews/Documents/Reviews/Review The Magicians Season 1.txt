Jam On Toast Review:
The Magicians (Season 1)

Format: Live Action
Applicable Genre: Sci-Fi, Fantasy, Magic

Hit or Skip:  Hit!
	If you can brave some trigger potential intense subject matters in this season, then this is a magically intricate show. 

General:
	Imagine Hogwarts for college students, I know many wizard rock songs that suggest there are plenty of people that have this as a personal fantasy.  Of course we have to lose the the childlike wonder of the boy that lived and instead embrace that our first character's magical ability nearly drives him insane.
	
Aesthetics:  90
	While we've got all the pretty people, time period accurate set and attire for time travel scenes, plenty of fantasical settings, the most intricate thing is that all the actors had to essentially learn a very specific very of sign language for spell casting.  Aside for a couple special effects and some horrific scenes, there special effects aren't the magic of this show.
	
Storyline:  92
	At least for this first season, we get the fantasy of getting into magic school, being rejected from magic school, being reject from the people rejected from magic school, battling with gods and god-like entities.  "The Beast" is a great villain all the way to the end of the season.
	
Character Development:  88
	Part of the fun of the show is that some of the characters are a little bit contentious, okay they're jerks, but they have to get along.  So that process, which involves loving and tolerating and fighting one another, gets a little tedious from time to time, but ultimately shows opportunity for discussions of various moralities.
	
Compulsion:  90
	Whether you want to laugh at the almost a family infighting, nerdiness, cry at the drama or be in awe of the action, this show has all of it in spades along with a latent horror vibe kiting you along to see what's next.
	
Final Score:  90
