Jam On Toast Review:
GLOW (Season 1)

Format: Live Action
Applicable Settings: Pre-Modern, 1980s
Applicable Genre: Slice of Life, Wrestling, Drama

Hit or Skip:  Hit!
	Definitely worth the watch, and you don't even have to be a wrestling fan.
	
General:

	
Aesthetics:  92
	They absolutely nailed the 1980s look, and they did wonders on personal details of the characters.  The transformation on Alison Brie is amazing, and, mostly because its a show about wrestling, the shots are fantastic.  The make sure to capture all the action possible, from the best angle possible.
	
Storyline:  94
	Every story in this is good.  This is a prime examlpe of how to write 19 different stories as one story without being distracting and without losing investment.  Even for the characters we don't like, I felt invested and each story supported the others.
	
Character Development:  94
	Because its a show about wrestling and actors finding their characters, it is natural the the stories are consitently building the characters.  Especially Ruth, each character comes out the other end of this adventure as new, accomplished characters.
	
Compulsion:  94
	I don't care if you like drama, comedy, action, history: this show has a little to a lot of all of it for you.  You can laugh, you can cry, love, hate all in this show and its a good time.  I'll admit a little bias as a once active wrestling fan, but I don't think its necessary.
	
Final Score:  94
	I think anyone can get something out of this, you just have to give it a chance.
