Jam On Toast Review:
The Magicians (Season 2)

Format: Live Action
Applicable Genre: Sci-Fi, Fantasy, Magic

Hit or Skip:  Hit!
	Fantastic to see the first season's story arc wrap up in the first 3 episodes and see where it goes.

General:
	
	
Aesthetics:  92
	With everything that we got in the first season, we get Fillory, its gods, invisible monsters and faeries.  The spellwork improves and as the drama of the story escalates the visuals do as well without nearly as much viscera as the first season.
	
Storyline:  88
	Okay, being honest, the story structure gets a little weird here: the first 3 episodes feel more like a prologue to a first season they didn't think they'd get to finish.  With the involvement of Fillory and the main cast splitting (again, this happened throughout the first season) its a little distracting as the cast is bouncing between worlds and dealing with multiple lead villains in additon to personal drama.
	
Character Development:  80
	I would imagine that a new season would reset the characters for development, but instead the characters are suddenly and dramatically changed in personality sporatically as they lose their "shade" or magic, or some other traumatic event occurs.  It would feel more satisfying if it felt like we were building on the same characters we knew, but it feels like those get thrown away to revitalize the story.
	
Compulsion:  90
	With all the weird and goofy things happening in this show, it shows the range available to the story, cast and production.  Even rewatching it, I was surprised at the progressiveness and innovation fo the show.
	
Final Score:  87.5
