		Eventually pans into a house with Julianne Moore
			She's looking at a picture of a boy, "Sam"
		Pyschologist talking with her about her time spent "at the dresser"
		She knows the time from when something happened
										I take it we're supposed to infer that the son is missing or dead
	Phone
		Conversation with a man
		Picture infers that it may be her husband
	Outside
		She talks with a Neighbor lady
		She thinks she parked her car in a place
		The guy there points it out
	Psychologist
		Doesn't want to talk about sex
		She thinks she had a cup of coffee, but doesn't
		Pyschologist explains it away
			Continued conversation about "forgetting" already
			Suggests that she may be "amplifying" memories of Sam
										This suggests that she is remembering things that don't exist
	Dinner
		She's supposed to be going "back to work"
		She sees a picture of them
			but no Sam
		She reacts, violently
										So WHY isn't Sam in the picture when she thinks he should be? crazy?
	Swings
		She meets a guy who lost his daughter?
			Ash
	Bed
		She comes home late
		Asks Jim not to ask her to let go (of Sam)
										So if she's the only one that remembers him, then does he exist?

		Psychologist comes over
			They try to convince she that she never had a son
										Sam was 9: 9 years of invented memories?

			Daily papers from 14 months ago
			"6 Missing children fear dead on plane"

	Street
		Neighbor lady doesn't remember Sam

			SHE USES A BUTTER KNIFE TO TEAR DOWN HIS WALLS
			And there's his daughter's room
										Why would that STILL BE THERE
