Scary Movie Squad: Alien

Opens with SPACE!

crew wakes up, to include a cat

lots of arguing over bonuses

they realize that they aren't home yet

Honestly, while I was having technical issues, there is a lot of empty shit here
	mostly we're looking at ships or tech, or talking about tech
	
They launch a ship to explore a nearby planet with proper gravitation.
	ship gets damaged
	
							Computers do not just show binary code

Find xenos ship with a giant dead guy with a holw in his chest

Someone actually suggests "we get the hell outta here"
	and they don't
	
Finally finds "eggs or something"
	face hugger emerges
	
Ripley is fighting the team based on quarantine procedures.
	another crewmate opens it
	
They cut off dude's helmet
	face hugger is wrapped on his face and neck

one guy is really into the idea of freezing the victim

cutting it reveals acid blood

														I noticed that the praticals are pretty bad in this

they decide to proceed with the same plan
	everyone is pretty upset
	ash and mother refuse to help
	girl is nearly hysterical
	no one has considered venting the ship
	
ash seems to be fucking with Ridley
	she attacks him
	he easily overpowers her
	rest of the crew shows up
	Ash is an android
				when headless and attack, it is positioned so obviously

alien hunting
	I was happy when the cute but cray girl died
	Ridley finds people stored for injection
	time runs out to stop self destruct
	
Ripley goes back to get jones (in the box)

Ripley launches an escape shuttle
