Viral

Format: Live Action
Applicable Settings: Modern
Applicable Genre: Horror, Zombie, Parasite, Infection

Hit or Skip:  Hit!
	A really good concept and direction of a horror movie.

General:
	

Aesthetics:  90
	There are some great praticals and visceral moments in this.  They do great establishing shots and foreshadowing visually about what's going to happen to soon.  Much of the story is told just through the some of the visuals, whether it is documentary footage on botflies or an infected peering through the bars of her cell and screaming to die before the parasite takes her.
	
Storyline:  88
	This movie doesn't realy follow all the traditional elements of a zombie/infection/parasite story.  Do get me wrong, they're there, we just focus on a couple elements for the purposes of the story.  We're not fighting, we're not even running.  We're hiding, surviving, dealing with and attempting to cure an infection.  The real story is a sister story where they're trying to survive together.  Dealing with someone in your party that is infected is a small trope in the zombie industry, but its powerful if you can care about the characters.
	
Character Development:  92
	The movie is dealing with the world being infected, dealing with being infected, dealing with your sister being infected, dealing with the girl you like's sister being infected.  Through the movie we're consistently seeing development as things are happening around and to the sisters.  Having one of the lead characters fight infection with everything she has is done really well.
	
Compulsion:  88
	While I find every bit of this movie interesting, in several different ways, I get that some people aren't going to be interested in any of the botfly stuff.  It very well may have been more entertaning to not educate the audience (because the characters barely learned anything) and just let her infection continue, but I'm not sure the characters would have motivation for that.
	
Final Score:  89.5
