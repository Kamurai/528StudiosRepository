#ScaryMovieSquad Review:
The Vault

Format: Live Action
Applicable Genre: Horror, Paranormal

Hit or Skip:  Skip!
	Really, if you are having trouble finding something to watch, this isn't bad, but there are better things to watch.

General:
	Solid concept, decent cast, good presentation, but I really don't know what went wrong.  The movie even does good misdirecton.  Something about this movie fails to get me invested enough to feel what I need to feel to make the movie good.

Aesthetics:  70
	The movie knows how to do audio cues, both in music and dialogue volume, though what they happen to be saying isn't always very meaningful.  There is a visual direction taken for the movie, but I can't say its much other than thematic.

Storyline:  75
	This doesn't feel like a very original storyline despite me not being able to come up with another movie that uses these particular tropes like this.  Its just empty enough to be forgetable and not written well enough to be very moving (or scary).

Character Development:  80
	Probably the one thing that the movie does well is explore its characters, to include the bank, and have us question morality all over the place, probably slightly much.
	
Compulsion:  40
	The movie doesn't bring much to the table to keep the audience engaged past the first viewing.  There are a couple surprises, but most of the movie is waiting to see if the pretty people are going to finally going to do something interesting and not getting it.  Even the "good" robber's noble actions fall short because its by and for characters we don't really care about.
	
Final Score:  66.25
	Not a bad movie, just maybe not what you expect out of a haunted bank movie.
