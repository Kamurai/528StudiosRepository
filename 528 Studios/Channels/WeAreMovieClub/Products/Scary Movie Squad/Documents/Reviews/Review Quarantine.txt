#ScaryMovieSquad Review:
Quarantine

Format: Live Action
Setting: Modern
Applicable Genre: Horror

Hit or Skip:  Hit!

General:
	This one of my favorite horror movies and the best approach I've seen to non-traditional zombie (infected) movies.  Most importantly, the movie just feels good on every level: even the frustrating bits.

Aesthetics:  94
	This is one of top movies I would recommend for a good example of found footage.  This is done almost entirely in one recording and all from the same camera so you don't get jarred away from the immersion.  I even forgot it was found footage, its done so well and seamless.  The makeup is done well and the actors pull off creepy rabies pretty well, including the young girl.
	
Storyline:  89
	Its got a good premise, and a decent mystery to discover, but a lot of the movie really is disorganized running around and committing atrocious mistakes.  I think the story is actually beautifully vague as if you could drop people into a video game of it: record they're choices and make several different movies from it and we got the most entertaining.
	
Character Development:  92
	Its really hard to determine if a character grows in a movie where they die, but this movie certainly tries.  Even without giving us lots of unnecessary back story (we get some just through occupation), we see these people go through a trauma and change because of it.  We see their roles get pushed and shifted during the crisis.
	
Compulsion:  94
	I'm not sure what it is.  I don't particularly like any of the characters.  There is minimal sexiness going on, but the action and suspense and way the movie is shot is wonderful.
	
Final Score:  92.25
	Please watch this if you're into horror and don't mind found footage / first person view.
