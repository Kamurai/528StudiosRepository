#ScaryMovieSquad Review:
Triangle

Format: Horror
Applicable Settings: Modern
Applicable Genre: Horror, Supernatural, Time Travel

Hit or Skip:  Hit!
	I love this attempt at a looping time travel movie.  Imagine Groundhog's Day without the sudden restart.

General:
	Time travel is the worst.  You can literally spend all day with charts and graphs and never get anywhere.  This is a fun approach where time exists linearly instead of branching, at least subjetively.

Aesthetics:  90
	There are some very powerful moments in the movie, particularly since they occur when you would assume there isn't much action happening.  That said, the action is done very well, and the repeated scenes are represented flawlessly.  Melissa George carries this movie on her re-acting to the situations, and from the character perspective, over and over again.  Despite just looking at her clothing for time clues, you can tell by how she is acting which version of her she is.
	
Storyline:  90
	Despite the story being based on a loop, the linear approach allows for deviations without breaking the immersion with bullshit paradoxes, or at least not in the traditional ways.  The multiple lockets and birds, the complicated series of events in which they find things essentially being done far after they're found makes this movie as intriguing as it is filled with action.
	
Character Development:  90
	If from nothing else than the trauma (that she causes herself), this character grows in leaps and bounds so that you can physically see the differences in her.  She literally changes characters through the movie, the movie representing which stage of the character she is at.
	
Compulsion:  90
	This is a fantastic way to do time travel, and feel very different from the normal ways people have attempted time travel in the past.  I have a good time everytime I watch this and despite the idea that its the same events occuring over and over, it always feels like I'm seeing something I hadn't seen before.
	
Final Score:  29
