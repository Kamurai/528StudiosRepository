#ScaryMovieSquad Review: Always Watching: A Marble Hornets Story
Format: Live Action
Applicable Genre: Horror

Hit or Skip:  Skip!

General:
	What an empty movie.  It is very hard to talk about a movie that does almost nothing.

Aesthetics:  40
	I'm actually a found footage fan, when it is actually done well.  This is an example of a movie that watched several good and popular found footage movies, was feed a creepy pasta and then just ignored half of it and pull out their old ghost story script to see how they could make that instead.  There are a few good shots and tricks done, but they are far few between.

Storyline:  25
	The story focuses less on Slenderman and more on the people investigating Slenderman.  Anytime there is danger, they just have the characters flee, and even have Slenderman run.  Any other interaction is over quickly and without a lot of thought put behind it.

Character Development:  15
	Having watch the entire movie, I don't remember the girl's name, I'm unsure on one of the guys' name and I only remember Milo because they were shouting it and because of "Milo and Otis".  This should be a good example of the work the invested into developing the characters and making them worthwhile.  Even Slenderman veers from the creepy pasta, acting more like a ghost or serial killer than the immortal Slenderman.

Compulsion:  10
	Watching this with people saved it only slightly for me and then it was just us talking about Slenderman, which version this issue, about found footage or how bad this thing is to which we're subjecting ourselves.
	
Final Score:  22.5
	Do not watch, unless you are a found footage junkie, and then afterwards: get help.
