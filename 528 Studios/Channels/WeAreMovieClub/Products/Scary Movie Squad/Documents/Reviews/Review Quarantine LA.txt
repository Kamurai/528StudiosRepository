#ScaryMovieSquad Review:
Quarantine LA

Format: Horror
Applicable Settings: Modern
Applicable Genre: Horror, Science Fiction

Hit or Skip:  Skip!
	What a lot of nothing happening in this movie.  I swear there is less than 30 zombies the whole movie.

General:
	For a movie based off a movie as good a Quarantine, which is, in turn, based off of the REC franchise, this has a LOT of garbage in it.  It feels more like we're concentrating on a small concentrated portion of the world from Residential Evil: Apocalypse.

Aesthetics:  51
	The copy I watched was barely acceptable as a movie.  It even does the annoying jump cuts between nonsensical dreams and nonsensical story.	
	
Storyline:  40
	Someone certainly wrote some scenes for this, and probably even had a good screenplay at one point, which is where the meat of the story comes from.  While treachery is fun and usually fits into survival horror, this feels more like corporate treachery and is a little awkward.
	
Character Development:  15
	I literally just assigned tropes to thes characters: the soldier, the convict, the store owner, the child, the wife, the doctor.  I don't feel they changed at all, or why I was supposed to care.
	
Compulsion:  10
	None, by the time we reach the first set of zombies and rescue the doctor, I was ready to drop this.  The movie doesn't make care about any of it.  I started hoping zombies would show up and give us some turn over on the character set.
	
Final Score:  29
