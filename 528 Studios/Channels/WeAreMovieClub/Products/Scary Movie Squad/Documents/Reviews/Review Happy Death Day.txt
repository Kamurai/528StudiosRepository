#ScaryMovieSquad Review:
Happy Death Day

Format: Live Action
Applicable Settings: Modern
Applicable Genre: Horror, Science Fiction

Hit or Skip:  Hit!
	If you always wanted a murder plot in Groundhog's Day, then this is a movie for you.

General:
	This is a niche genre that really needs more attention, while I still prefer a fatalistic timeline (one that is continuous rather than restarts), the restart format creates a deep experience allows the writer to play with "what if" scenarios where its near impossible in other formats.

Aesthetics:  94
	My biggest problem with the aesthetics is that stupid ass baby mask.  It takes the wind out of the scene on more than one occasion.  Otherwise the scenes are dressed wonderfully, the time-looped scenes are very consistent.  Most importantly, Jessica Rothe carries the movie with her wide ranging ability to emote: she does crazy really well, from manic to psychotic break.  
	
Storyline:  90
	While there is a significant influence from Groundhog's Day: the murder plot is the actual story.  There are a few spots where it feels like she gain more knowledge than she could have is so few restarts, and a few very cliche moments, but these are minor complaints as they mechanically move the plot forward and help support misdirection and suspense for the audience.
	
Character Development:  90
	She might be a crazy person.  She is all over the place and seems to be catapulted forward by trauma, even empowered by her trauma at one point.  For the idea of being trapped in time as she is, she handles it wonderfully and from her backstory, and the first 10 minutes, she completely redeems herself and looks like she's moving forward as good person by the end of everything.
	
Compulsion:  91
	Jessica Rothe really carries this movie and does it well.  There isn't a whole lot from many of the other actors, while they have their moments (mostly in fights).  But the movie reminds me a lot of Scream and Scream Queens where part of the movie is to subtly explore the structure of a slasher movie.
	
Final Score:  91.25
	I really want more movies that make me feel like this does.
