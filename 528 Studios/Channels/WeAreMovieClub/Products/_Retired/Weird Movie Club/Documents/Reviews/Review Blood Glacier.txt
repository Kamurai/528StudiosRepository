#WeirdMovieClub Review:
Blood Glacier

Format:  Live Action
Applicable Settings: Modern
Applicable Genres:  Horror, Creature Feature

Hit or Skip:  Skip!
	Whether or not you're okay with subtitles, this flips between boring and weird the whole time.
	
General:
	I'm not saying that this movie is without positive aspects, but they feel like they're far and few between.  Being a foreign movie, there are inherit cultural divides: trying to watch the movie and read the words only amplifies that.  The practical effects are probably the best part of this movie, but the characters, storyline and premise are all disappointing on the execution.
	
Aesthetics:  80
	The idea of having giant bugs and infectious is really good, though the idea that it's a natural biological evolution based off of some algae makes for a better view than it does any sense.  The creature design definitely had a lot of thought put into it and the pratical effects look really good, most of the time.  So of the goofy acting from the actual people varies from entertaining to offsetting the practical work.
	
Storyline:  70
	The premise is flimsy and gives us the barest excuse for monsters on this mountain.  While there are some heavy hitting and well timed moments in the writing, most of it seems to be a bare minimum job to just connect one moment to another.  The broken relationship sub plot was honestly awkward to deal with during everything else happening.
	
Character Development:  60
	It felt like I was missing the joke on the having this set of characters, and most of the people were pretty stupid, even for scientists: and not a one of them learned a bloody thing from the experience.  That the characters were willing to TAKE THE DOG BABY THING AWAY AT THE END OF THE MOVIE IS LUDICROUS.
	
Compulsion:  50
	I very sadly got bored and distracted at several points during the movie, other people were kind enough to fill me in: it didn't help.  Seeing the buggers was fun, though some of the goofy acting and weird scenarios were off putting.
	
Final Score:  65
