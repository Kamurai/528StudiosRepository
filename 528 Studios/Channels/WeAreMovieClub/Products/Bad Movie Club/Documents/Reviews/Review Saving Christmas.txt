#BadMovieClub Review: Saving Christmas

Hit or Skip:  Skip!

General:
	I would say that I don't know what Kirk Cameron was thinking when he made this movie, but he starts the movie off with exactly that.  Other than a look at the idea of people falling out of the spirit of Christmas versus Christmas as a cultist activity, this entire movie feels like a disjointed waste of time.

Aesthetics:  50
	It might have been the copy I was watching, but this movie is poorly produced with grainy visual and poor quality audio.  To make every awkward scene even worse, they even include a weird music video towards the end of the movie.  Otherwise its a Christmas movie staged in a Christmas party with weird flashbacks and sub stories.

Storyline:  20
	The story is super basic, a guy convinces his brother back into loving Christmas.  It doesn't mean he's right or there is any value in the holiday, its just that he "believes" again.

Character Development:  10
	There are several sub stories that we could look at for this, but ultimately the only one that matters is the brother who is convinced back into loving Christmas.  This entire process could be reduced to a 5 minute conversation.

Compulsion:  10
	I cannot believe I sat through this entire movie.  Religious preferences aside this was horrible thing to sit through.

Final Score:  22.5
	I can’t recommend this movie.  Even for a Bad Movie Night, on use this movie as a form of torture.
