#BadMovieClub  Review:
Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back

Format:  Live Action
Applicable Settings: Modern
Applicable Genres:  Comedy

Hit or Skip:  Hit!
	Even if you have seen the other referenced movies (Clerks, Mallrats, Chasing Amy, and Dogma), its a good time all on its own.

General:
	

Aesthetics:  88
	Especially as the main focus, Jay and Silent Bob make a good look for central characters.  Jason Mewes is funny and animated on camera and Smith does a great job of emoting as a silent counterpart.  The movie is full of good music and odd moments like like Jay having angel and devil(s) on his shoulders, Susan, Good Will Hunting 2, and the Mysterious Machine.

Storyline:  90
	As basic of a story as it is, two idiots go to hollywood to stop a movie from getting made, its actually a really good basis to build on for all the shenanigans that happen along the way.  The hijicks are almost written episodically and it works.

Character Development:  85
	Funny enough Jay and Silent Bob are idiot characters that learn very little in their own adventure.  The majority of growth actually happens with Justice and some of the side characters that Jay and Bob indaverdently inspire.  They learn about the how the world actually works, and literally about the internet, but the most growth Jay has is to call Justice "Boo Boo Kitty Fuck".

Compulsion:  92
	This movie is funny, filled with good references and cameos and a bevy of great sub plots.  The movie flows well, and stands on its own, but its even better if you've got some View Askew history on your side.  So Kevin Smith fans, go back and watch all 6 movies in this series, to include Clerks 2.
	
Final Score:  88.75
	It not award winning, but enjoyable.
