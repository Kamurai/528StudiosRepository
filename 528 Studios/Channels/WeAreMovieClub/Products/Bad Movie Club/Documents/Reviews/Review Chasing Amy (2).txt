#BadMovieClub  Review:
Chasing Amy

Format:  Live Action
Applicable Settings: Modern (1990s)
Applicable Genres:  Comedy

Hit or Skip:  Hit!
	This is probably one of the strongest movies Kevin Smith has made.

General:
	For what might look like a dick and fart bromance, this is a deceptively deep romantic comedy that pushes boundaries even now and especially back in the 1990s when this was made.

Aesthetics:  85
	There are some great parallels in this movie, especially the hockey game.  The music is weighted perfectly for each scene so that the movie feels exactly how it needs to feel.  While its not an epic looking movie, it delivers just enough to be everything it needs to be.

Storyline:  92
	This is a rollercoaster, you can cry, laugh, yell all in the same movie.  No matter your perspective, I think you'd have a side in this story.  That said, the idea of it, a guy that is in love with a lesbian, is a little ridiculous and I'm not sure if it would have worked in a more serious setting.  The comic book writer angle allows for goofy scenarios and timelines that we wouldn't get with other professions.

Character Development:  88
	Most of the character development comes from sexual adventuring of some degree.  We have a straight girl that eventually becomes a lesbian, that falls in love with a guy.  We have a straight guy that finds himself eventually in a position to bang his best guy friend.  We have a closet gay guy that finally realizes that he's been in love with someone for years.  Most of the story is about how we identify ourselves through out sexual experience, and while I don't think it is an identity unto itself it can be an important part of our lives and this is a fun exploration of that.

Compulsion:  85
	This is a enjoyable approach to a serious topic of love, sex and identity.  While it definitely has some deeper more powerful moments, filled with screaming, slapping, and crying, a lot of the movie is the crude, yet intelligent discussions on this or that, and that is something Director Smith does very well.
	
Final Score:  87.5
