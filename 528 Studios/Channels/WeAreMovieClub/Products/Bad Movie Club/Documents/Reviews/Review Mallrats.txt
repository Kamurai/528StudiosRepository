#BadMovieClub  Review:
Mallrats

Format:  Live Action
Applicable Settings: Modern (1990s)
Applicable Genres:  Comedy

Hit or Skip:  Hit!
	The movie is filled with great conversation pieces and plenty of hilarious physical comedy.

General:
	Watching this movie in 2017 makes it feel a little cliche, but I remember two things: Smith drew from what he knew, comics and the movies he'd experienced so far.  So many of the things that might feel cliche were newer, if common, at the time and just part of what you use to construct (bro)romantic narratives, even today.

Aesthetics:  80
	Being it was made in the 1990s, it nails the look and takes me back.  Even the mall itself looks out of date by today's standards.  But the important components are there, and they use it for some great scenes and physical comedy.  I also really love that the managed to create a set on the set for the game show, but most of the important bits of the movie are just people having casual conversations.

Storyline:  85
	This had a great balance between storylines, we change when we need to change and no one gets left behind in the process.  The stories themselves: two bros reinforcing they're broship and two guys trying to win back their ladies a little old hat, but that the respective antagonists have their own agendas and storylines that are moving counter to the protagonists' storylines which is what makes it the work of art it is.

Character Development:  85
	We have growth on all sides, almost every character has a tiny moral / gain, to include (in theory) the antagonists.  I hate starting out with unrelatable asshole protagonists that grow into respectable people, but these idiots are at least somewhat fun in the way they go about it.

Compulsion:  86
	There are great conversations, jokes and scenes in this.  Material for comic book fans galore.  Smith even snuck in a little nudity, with a great twist to potentially ruin the same for the sake of comedy.
	
Final Score:  84
	If you liked Clerks, bromances, or quirky romantic comedies, then check this out.
