#BadMovieClub  Review: Maximum Ride

Format:  Live Action
Applicable Settings: Sci-fi
Applicable Genres:  Action

Hit or Skip:  Skip!

General:
	There just doesn't seem to much other than a rip off of X-Men here.

Aesthetics:  65
	It looked alright.  The sets and music were alright.  Max was hot, but that shouldn't be the thing I'm noting about a MOVIE.  The CG for the wings was horribly shoddy quality except in the bedroom where I felt like it was someone's little fantasy I was watching.

Storyline:  50
	This really just feels like someone rewrote X-Men enough so that they wouldn't get sued, but had angel looking kids that couldn't actually fight and weren't that strong, but thought they were.  There are so many gaps to fill in that if the average person watched this without reading the source material, I'm not sure it would be clear at all.

Character Development:  60
	I think the writers thought they were developing characters throughout the entire movie, but I feel like we started with empty characters that never really filled.  We get some development on Jeb, but they leave it a little too open ended, both in the villain's plot and the end of the movie leading to the sequel.

Compulsion:  45
	I'm not sure what to get out of this, the action scenes are short and unsatisfying.  The drama isn't doesn't feel engaging.  The erasers are weird and the villainous corporation is so mysterious I couldn't care to investigate it.
	
Final Score:  55
	Ultimately, I can't recommend this, and I don't think the sequel will be approved.
