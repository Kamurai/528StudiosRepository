#BadMovieClub  Review: Maximum Ride
Format:  Live Action
Applicable Settings: Sci-fi
Applicable Genres:  Action

Hit or Skip:  Skip!

General:
	There was very little of value hear.  This feels like a imitation / mockery of Scream attempting to be meta about the ridiculousness of horror movie tropes.

Aesthetics:  70
	

Storyline:  50
	

Character Development:  70
	If the vapid empty characters were supposed to mean something, I missed it.  Even the argumentative killers with different motives undermined intead of debated the point of slasher killers.

Compulsion:  40
	
	
Final Score:  48.75
