#BadMovieClub  Review:
Dogma

Format:  Live Action
Applicable Settings: Modern
Applicable Genres:  Comedy, Religious

Hit or Skip:  Hit!
	This is a great capture of Mr. Smith's religious crisis, whether or not its over.

General:
	Probably the second greatest story Mr. Smith has written to date, with the first being Red State.

Aesthetics:  88
	Who wouldn't love a movie with a rubber poop monster in it.  Great score to set the moood, the angel wings are done extremely well, and each scene is dressed well and is entertaining through physically comedy or witty dialogue.

Storyline:  90
	This feels like a huge story for a Kevin Smith film, and that's to his credit not against.  Drawing characters from all over with two angels traveling from Wisconsin to New Jersey to end all of existence feels like an epic story, and using fun characters like Jay and Silent Bob for brevity makes the religious aspect of it all more palatable for all parties.  Just the premise that god has this complicated failsafe involving all these moving parts is enough to get the chuckles started.

Character Development:  88
	That Jay and Silent Bob could save the world is growth enough, but the movie is literally Bethany wrestling with her own crisis of faith with it coming to life all around her to not make her believe again, but see that its the truth.  The angels reconcile with the intent of their maker, Rufus and Serendipity even grow a little bit from the adventure realizing that belief will lead even them along the right path.

Compulsion:  85
	This movie is clever, funny, tense, and has enough just enough action in it to wow you.  I had a good time, and I would surprised if you didn't unless you're just offended, but that's okay too.
	
Final Score:  87.75
