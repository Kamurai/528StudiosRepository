Hit or Skip:  Hit!
	Its the top of the line for bad movies, and not quite the bottom of the barrel for good movies

General:
	

Aesthetics:  88
	The practical effects are pretty good and reminds me a lot of the times when we didn't have cg option equivalents.  While stylized, it is still pretty good and detailed if nothing else.  They visual timing and audio effects are fun really work for what the movie is.  And its good to have a "bad movie" with decent quality to it.

Storyline:  85
	The storyline is actually really well put together.  Everything feels like it builds the 3rd act properly.  The twists with the changelings are really well done, though it raises some logistical questions.  I'd ask for more information on how everything works, but they have an entire scene of it, and maybe I just didn't pay enough attention.

Character Development:  80
	While the characters are largely static, there is the adventure of coming to terms with lycanthropy is its own development.  Tina is own of the few characters, besides the meth heads, that gets legitimate development and walks out of the movie a little better.

Compulsion:  88
	This is just a fun and funny movie.  The writing and effects are just good enough that pretty much the entire movie is enjoyable.  Whether you're trying to figure out the mystery, laughing at werewolf hijinks or enjoying a silly twist in the story, this movie is good enough or better.
	
Final Score:  85.25
	Have fun watching a good bad movie with this one.
