#WeirdMovieClub Review: Death Note
Format:  Live Action
Applicable Settings: Modern
Applicable Genres:  Horror, Mystery

Hit or Skip:  Hit!

General:
	The biggest problem with this movie is that they made it a movie.  That sounds counter intuitive, but the story of Death Note is so much that it feels wrong to shove it all into such a short time line.

Aesthetics:  92
	While some of the Americanization was a little weird, Ryuk and L alone, with the music and the details of the scenes are enought for me to tell you to go watch this alone.

Storyline:  85
	A (smart) kid finding the power to kill anyone in the world promotes ONE question, "Should he?", so the entire concept becomes an exercise in morality.  That in itself is not entirely impressive, but how they approach it could be very intereting.  Because this was written for an American audience there are very stupid mechanics used to show motivation so the audience can relate to Light and Mia as real people.

Character Development:  75
	This is where I'm terribly disappointed.  I think, because of how they had to simplify it for the american audience, most of the characters aren't as interesting as they should be.  Light shows he's true colors at the end of the movie instead of the beginning.  Doing people's homework does not show you're a genius.  Showing Mia manipulating other people would have given some clever forshadowing, or even just having Ryuk talk to her, or show her with the note pages gives the audience the chance to talk about her side of the morality question.

Compulsion:  88
	Even with half the main characters being as bland as they are, everything they are doing is interesting, when it isn't being fast forwarded as it is all leading towards something big.  Even this movie itself is just a cog in the wheel of what will happen in the eternal story of Death Note.

Final Score:  85
	Such a great concept, pretty good execution. If you just don't have time to watch the anime, go for this instead.
