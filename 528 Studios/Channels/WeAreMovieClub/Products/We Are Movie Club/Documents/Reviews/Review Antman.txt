#WeAreMovieClub Review:
Antman

Format: Live Action
Applicable Genres: Modern
Applicable Settings: Comics, Sci-Fi, Action

Hit or Skip:  Hit!
	Despite it not being a super hero that is going fight Thanos or Hulk on his own, I find the idea of Antman to be fantastic.

General:
	I am in love with perspective, and this movie has a lot of it: being tiny in everyday scenes.  Alternating his size between tiny and normal and having an enemy that does the same is a lot of fun for me.
	
Aesthetics:  97
	I'm completely biased.  There are so few movies where I can get this sort of perspective play, and this gives me not only great perspective scenes, but really entertaining ones.  Paul Rudd, alongside his costars, is great a doing physical comedy and delivering great quippy dialogue.
	
Storyline:  94
	While there is a trope (on the verge of cliche) of heroes fighting like villains for the epic climax, a lot of this is a overly complicated heist movie.  That's a good thing, but it may not be what people were expecting when they tried to watch a super hero movie.  For those that brave a difference experience, I think they're really going to enjoy this.  It good to see something different in the Marvel Cinematic Universe than mindless violence.
	
Character Development:  95
	Paul Rudd outshines everyone in this movie with Scott Lang, despite their excellent performances.  We see a man going crazy, a man going desperate, a dad and daughter reforge a relationship and new families forge and bonding.  Not only do we get new characters out of the old by the end of the movie, but the dynamics change so drastically we literally have a guy asking if he's now a "good guy" because its weird for him.
	
Compulsion:  92
	This movie is just fun, thanks mostly to Paul Rudd, and is well written enough to keep you entertained on the journey to more epic moments.
	
Final Score:  94.5
	For a street level hero, Antman is top of the line and has the potential to take it to another level.  Watch this now so you have the context for whenever this plucky hero shows up.
