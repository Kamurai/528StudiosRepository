#WeAreMovieClub Review: Pirates of the Carribean: Dead Men Tell No Tales

Hit or Skip:  Hit!

General:
	I don't know about you, but I love these stupid movies.  They are fun and full of spectacle and wonderful, laughable moments and great action scenes.  I recently came to the realization that these movies have incredible serendipity not unlike Star Wars.  Jack Sparrow could have the mysterious power of The Force guiding him with all the luck he carries.

Aesthetics:  95
	From the costumes, to the ships, to the ridiculously shot scenes and a nearly perfect score.  If nothing else, then Disney has the money to invest to get great looking scenes.  They certainly didn't leave off many details, from every tooth and bustier to the negative space in the ghosts.

Storyline:  80
	Turning the clock forward 20 years was an odd choice, but I assume they were testing the waters, so to speak, about seeing if franchise could live on without Jack Sparrow as the main lead.  At one point in the movie there are about 5 teams all going after the same macguffin, and I honestly had to stop and sort out WHY everyone was there.  There are filmsy reasoning abound throughout the movie.  The movie could honestly have benefitted from taking out about half of it and extending the more interesting bits, particularly actually getting ahold of the trident.

Character Development:  88
	Other than the many, many people that died almost everyone grows in some formidable direction.  However, the direction of growth is pretty much back to how they all started.  This movie is all about reuniting and dweling on the past.  Ultimately I think we're supposed to learn to let go and appreciate the future somehow, but I'm not positive it comes across quite right.

Compulsion:  88
	Fun.  This movie is one fun scene after the next.  If you can get out of your own way enough, then you'll probaby enjoy almost every scene.  There are some slower scenes that are used for development or setting up the next scene.  But you can easily wait for the next special thing and be satisfied when you get it.

Final Score:  87.75
	This is a fun, entertaining movie.  While I don't think it would necessarily win an award, it should entertain you and all your guests.
