#WeAreMovieClub Review:
Thor 2: The Dark World

Format: Live Action
Applicable Genres: Modern
Applicable Settings: Comics, Sci-Fi, Action

Hit or Skip:  Hit!
	If you like Thor, you want more Thor, or just complete your infinity stone backstory, watch it.

General:
	Look, as someone who is not a fan of Thor, he's a laugh.  Hemsworth does a great job with the character and Natalie Portman is always a delight to see on screen.  While Malik isn't a great villain, having Loki in the mix creates enough tension to get us to the climax.
	
Aesthetics:  90
	Marvel does such a good job making these movies look fantastic.  Its not jsut armored dude with a ponytail playing with red sand.  Even more than space and Asgard, the ilussion trickery really adds a special spice to the look.
	
Storyline:  70
	The writing feels...forced?  I'm not sure if the that's the right way to put it honestly, but they knew they had to make another Thor movie and that it had to have x amount of factors, to include this story about space elves and the aether so it could be linked to the other infinity stone movies, and this business with the convergence.
	
Character Development:  75
	I want to say that we learned lessons about how to pick our friends, family and enemies, but they outright say it several times about who to trust and who not to trust, and the characters don't learn a damn thing.  Jane Foster even gets screwed over by Thor leaving her again.  There were some fun bits with her experiencing Asgard and actual war and even that Loki could be helpful is untrustworthy.
	
Compulsion:  80
	This is by far not the best Thor movie, probably not even better than the first movie.  But there's fun and action to be had.  Fun character and cool special effects.  The idea of fighting a battle by remote control portals alone is enough to convince to give this a watch.
	
Final Score:  78.75
