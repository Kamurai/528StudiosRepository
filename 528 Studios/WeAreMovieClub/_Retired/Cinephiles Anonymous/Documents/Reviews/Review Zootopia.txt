#CinephilesAnonymous Review: Zootopia

Hit or Skip:  Hit!

General:
	This is movie is wonderfully put together.  Disney definitely has the resources to put quality into there computer generated content.

Aesthetics:  90
	All the hair, all the fur, the snow has magnificient detail to it.  The characters are designed to be absolutely adorable and really are going to draw in the audience.  Even the concern of animals looking too similar to distinguish isn't an issue.  The movie has great audio cues throughout even without having outright sing alongs.  There are even small visual references to other shows, like breaking bad.

Storyline:  90
	The story is focused on discovering where the missing predators have gone.  The case itself tells a lot of what is happening without giving much away.  Having a such a complex mystery to solve in a family movie is rare and amazing even without the parallels of racism weighing down your spirit or your thoughts.

Character Development:  85
	They sub plots in this movie are entirely centered around growing the individual characters through social expectations to be better people.  Judy deals with her (somewhat legitimate) issues with predators while everyone on the force is dealing with their prejudice against her, and Nick is not only dealing with both of those prejudices, but general prejudice from society and backlash from some of his previous adventures.

Compulsion:  90
	This is a fun movie.  There are jokes for all ages piled into this movie.  The overall story is intriguing and watching the character interact and grow is not only adorable, but really satisfying.

Final Score:  88.75
	Such a great movie, cute animals, plus a good mystery, solid action and comedy.  Fun for the family.
