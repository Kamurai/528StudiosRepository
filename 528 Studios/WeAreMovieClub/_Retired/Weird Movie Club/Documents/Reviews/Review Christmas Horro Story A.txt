#WeirdMovieClub Review: A Christmas Horror Story

Hit or Skip:  Hit!

General:
	Other than being 4 seperate stories all spliced together, this is a really well put together movie.

Aesthetics:  85
	There are some great effects going on in this movie, in particular Krampus is magnificient.  The corrupted elves could have been done better, but definitely met par.  While the other stories failed to set a truely horrific scene (at least one that creates any amount of tension) the changling story certainly sets one up with dead dad, following by mother having to fight her son.  The Krampus and Santa storylines definitely put that wild tension in for the monster chases/fights.

Storyline:  80
	Each story has their own merits, but I think I would have rather had one good story, or at least have it told to me in a manner in which I'm no constantly being pulled away from investments.

Character Development:  75
	Each story has at least one character that get thoroughly developed, but most characters are particularly disposable as in true horror story fashion.

Compulsion:  80
	Unfortunately, everytime you get realy invested in what's happening the story cuts away to a different story.  The invidual stories are interesting enough on their own, but the movie kills its own momentum.

Final Score:  80
	If you want watch a holiday horror movie, this is a pretty good bet that you'll enjoy this.
