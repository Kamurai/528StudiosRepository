#WeirdMovieClub Review:
Logan

Format:  Live Action
Applicable Settings: Modern
Applicable Genres:  Comics, Sci-Fi

Hit or Skip:  Hit!
	Its great to see not only "old man Logan", but Wolverine unleashed!  And X-23!

General:
	It took far too long to give us a more familar, more legitimate Wolverine.  A lot of this is clouded by Logan and Charles being old and sick, but in a very special way, it really makes the movie.
	
Aesthetics:  92
	Man, they really go the details right on this: Logan's puss filled knuckles to scars on his cheeks.  How Charles is acting crazy, the make up effects like on our albino friend.  And I think just with behaviour and presentation X-23 steals the show.  Highly impressive with her stunt abilities as an actress.
	
Storyline:  82
	While both the X-23 and Xavier premises are decent, the storyline of the movie is mostly them sitting around, possibly hiding, or Logan yelling at Charles which is fun, but doesn't really lead anywhere.  The action of the movie covers most of the runtime.
	
Character Development:  91
	Logan is probably the truest version of Wolverine yet, and Charles is basically insane.  That said, watching both of those characters dealing with their problems together creates some interesting situations.  Just watching X-23 become an actually person is amazing: Dafne Keen nailed it.
	
Compulsion:  90
	Regardless of the lack of story, the actors give a great performance.  These moments could have been done as shorts and been just as good, but all together they make the movie something great to laugh and ooo at.
	
Final Score:  88.75
	Like most action movies, there are a few scenes here you coul watch over and over, but I definitely recommend everyone watch this (eventually) at least once.
