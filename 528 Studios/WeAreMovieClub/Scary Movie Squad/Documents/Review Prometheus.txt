#ScaryMovieSquad Review:
Prometheus

Format: Live Action
Applicable Settings: Future
Applicable Genre: Horror, Science Fiction

Hit or Skip:  Hit!
	Fun to see where Xenomorphs started.

General:
	This is a good attempt at an origin story for classic sci-fi horror movie.  

Aesthetics:  91
	This movie looks great, and you can tell they put high consideration into the design of alien creatures as they had to be similar enough to their future counterparts to be recognizable, but different enough to be recognized as ancestors of the same.
	
Storyline:  60
	An expedition team going to an unknown planet to discover pre-human existence is a little bit of a weak premise if not for the slew of nonsense that goes wrong once they go planetside.  I'd give more credit to the written calamities if 90% of the movie wan't driven by the android's treachery which isn't (especially at this point in the franchise) surprising or moving.
	
Character Development:  40
	An unfortunate side effect to look for in movies is just useless unmemorable characters: this tends to happen when all the characters are going to die.  Writers don't feel the need to development them properly if they are just there to die, but that also means that the characters don't mean anything when they die so the entire point to the character equates to nothing.  The android has the most development out of the rest of the cast combined, including Shaw.
	
Compulsion:  80
	Looking past the characters, or at least focusing on their more entertaining bits, there are lots of interesting bits of foreshadowing and refrences to the rest of the franchise.  The 3 iconic scenes for this would be worth watching the movie for, but they're comparatively short.
	
Final Score:  67.75
