#ScaryMovieSquad Review: House on Willow Street

Hit or Skip:  Skip!

General:
	As much as I was excited for this one, it almost immediately disappoints.  We're given a completely disjointed prologue, followed by a poorly executed plan.  Watching people bumble a kidnapping attempt isn't nearly as exciting as one might think.  Being that its ultimately a Rorsach scenario, where the kidnappers are trapped with there kidnap victim, and that victim is a demon using their anguish against them, the concept really begins to take off, but maybe not so much the execution.

Aesthetics:  80
	This movie is scattered with interesting visuals, but is bogged down with dark, dreary scenes of just NOTHING.  While some of the subtlies help, most of the movie is fairly poor and boring looking, and the HORRIBLE wire work with the aerial harnesses towards the end definitely hurt the movie's look.  On top of that, someone's tentacle fetish got worked into the movie, and while the idea of projecting the tentacle tongues into another person to infect/possess them makes some sense, it going to the point of one of the guys' dead mother frenching was a little much.  Visually, its a lot more grotesque than horrifying.

Storyline:  30
	The story is pretty basic, but is written in a way to pad the movie's runtime.  Not only did we do a prolonged surprise reveal in the middle of the movie, but it did a very typical thing where the demon just seems to take forever to demon properly.  Even when it begins to confront the humans or even has the advantage it just takes so	long to make things happen, which is ultimately a problem.  I know horror stories are fueled by stupidity, but stupidity on the villain's side just slows the movie down.

Character Development:  20
	As mentioned, these characters are stupid and sloppy as well as shallow.  There is just nothing much there.  Some arbitrary backstory is applied for the purpose of having their ghosts follow and harrass them, but that is just an extension of their character traits.  I'm not even sure that the movie mentions their actual names, I certainly don't remember them.

Compulsion:  40
	The synopsis for this movie had me excited, but the movie itself just lets me down.  I got interested when we saw each ghost for the first time, but it was short lived.  The super intricate work done on the tentacle tongues made me want to look at pretty much anything else rather than the hard work they put into creating them.  None of the characters are particularly funny or moving and the scenes are lacking the tension that normally exists during horror movie chase scenes.
	
Final Score:  42.5
	I can’t recommend this movie.  Even for a Bad Movie Night, you’ll probably find it lacking.
