#ScaryMovieSquad Review:
Predator 2

Format: Live Action
Applicable Settings: Modern
Applicable Genre: Horror, Science Fiction, Action

Hit or Skip:  Skip!
	Having a Predator hunting in the city, just sounds stupid.

General:
	I'm amazed at how almost every aspect of this movie got better, but resulted in a worse movie.  Maybe it's the loss of suspense or we can just blame the human element.

Aesthetics:  70
	While the city is a more exciting place and allows for more human variety, it's almost as faceless as the jungle and somehow less intricate.  In addition, while the Predator looks a little better here, he looks goofy with a city backdrop, like he's a ninja turtle or something.
	
Storyline:  60
	There is actual story here: the agency has been tracking Predator activity, and Danny Glover's team is hunting the Predator out for it's murders.  The latter goes south and pivots into the first, but there's an actual story here that links the first movie and sets up for a sequel.
	
Character Development:  51
	Danny Glover certainly goes for a ride, but his team goes from dealing with one criminal to another, and the spooky agency is just that.
	
Compulsion:  49
	I don't know what is about the Predators that leaves me underwhelmed.  Having one Predator killing weak humans that aren't prepared isn't fun, (from the first movie) having capable fodder agains the Predator isn't fun, but having the Xenomorphs as an overwhelming force is.  It must be something to do with the setting of a City where all this craziness attracts no attention.
	
Final Score:  57.5
