#ScaryMovieSquad Review:
AVP: Alien versus Predator

Format: Live Action
Applicable Settings: Modern
Applicable Genre: Horror, Science Fiction, Action

Hit or Skip:  Hit!
	Finally Predators git good.

General:
	This is where Predators started getting fun for me.  Most likely it was more of the Xenomorphs going against a more capable foe, but I enjoyed movie: it was a good time for me.

Aesthetics:  90
	Finally the cg meets expectations: the invisibility is solidly done, and the Xenomorphs are a fun mix of lifelike cg and praticals.
	
Storyline:  88
	The majority of the movie is, "Hey we're trapped and being hunted", but I think it's the idea of being confined in this temple is what helps make this better.  This, from the Predator perspective, being a training moment of honor helps as well, and at least the humans and Xenomorphs have a reason for being there, despite the humans not being equipped for the situation.
	
Character Development:  92
	The inter-species connection helps immensely: despite all the time wasted dealing with the humans, the last Predator realizing that (the last) human could be useful somehow.  That with all the discovery of the temple itself there is a broad connection of survival versus sport.
	
Compulsion:  88
	The actual Predator versus Xenomorph is formidable versus formidable whereas the humans are glass cannons in the best of scenarios.  Unfortunately by the time there is a cause to be tactical about the situation, most of the humans (and Predators) are dead, but the shifting structure keeps things interesting.
	
Final Score:  89.5
