#ScaryMovieSquad Review:
Alien Resurrection

Format: Live Action
Applicable Settings: Modern
Applicable Genre: Horror, Science Fiction

Hit or Skip:  Hit!
	A great late 90's take on Alien.

General:
	I honestly think this is my favorite Alien movie.  It's just goofy and weird enough with multiple twists to keep the movie interesting and refreshing.

Aesthetics:  88
	This is probably the first movie that uses cg xenomorphs to any degree of success.  The space scenes look great and the pratical work with the creatures is well done.  The underwater scene (though I'm unsure why it exists) is downright beautiful.
	
Storyline:  85
	While the premise that any organization would still want to try to weaponize the xenomorphs is ludicrous, the involvement of the mercs, having a super Ripley on board and Carl's infiltration make a for a great multi-threaded story inside a floating kill box.
	
Character Development:  88
	The movie is 0filled with philosophical purpose centered on what it is to be, whether it's human, clone, or android, and the survival of society.  Even finding Terra in the state it's in when they get there feels like a statement on what the point of survival is without preserving some quality of life.
	
Compulsion:  90
	Winona Ryder as Carl does a fantastic job, and its a role like Carl's that helps the movie be as off beat as it is for me to enjoy it as much as I do.  The xenomorphs are threatening and the team is capable, which helps make an immersive story.  Adding all the new scenes and creature scenarios helps freshen the Alien story at a time when it needed it.
	
Final Score:  87.75
