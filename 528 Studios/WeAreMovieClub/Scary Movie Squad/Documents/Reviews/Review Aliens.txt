Format: Live Action
Applicable Settings: Future, Space
Applicable Genre: Horror, Science Fiction, Creature Feature

Hit or Skip:  Hit!
	Just don't expect Alien and you'll be fine.

General:
	It is really hard to see Alien and predict that this is what they would do with the sequel.  Ultimately it probably came down to an increase in budget, that they could afford to do more than one xenomorph that took it the direction it went.

Aesthetics:  88
	The xenomorphs are properly done this time, and really cool to see them in mass.  The face huggers are probably more terrifying as they have more suspenseful scenes and the xenomorphs seem more like kidnappers than killers.  The queen is a basically a dinosaur and have some of the best looking scenes around it.  The biggest problem was that if I had to hear Newt scream one more time, then I was going to put my fist through the screen.
	
Storyline:  85
	I cannot believe that the company's agenda regarding this creature hasn't changed at all.  I'm not even sure why the company thinks this is a good bio-weapon.  After losing a ship, and a whole colony, they still want it, and all the xenomorphs did was sit there after they took the colony.  As serious as a planetary threat it might be, just not going there, or killing them from 
	orbit sounds like a better solution.
	
Character Development:  80
	The characters are pretty polarized: either they're a stock character that never changed or they're survivors.  Ripley takes a motherly development through the movie with the introduction of Newt, who is adapting to so much trauma in such a short time.  I'm equally impressed with how stupid the company man is about staying alive as how much the CPL turns to Ripley's perspective and actually saving the day.
	
Compulsion:  80
	I can't pretend this is a great movie, it takes about 45 minutes to actually start the movie.  Even then there is a lot of supposed tension when its more of just empty space.  This is probably more of the modern perspective just being faster with shorter attention spans.
	
Final Score:  83.25
