#ScaryMovieSquad Review:
Alien versus Predator: Requiem

Format: Live Action
Applicable Settings: Modern
Applicable Genre: Horror, Science Fiction

Hit or Skip:  Hit!
	This has everything good about the first AVP, plus a slow burn.

General:
	While AVP took a lot less to start it's action than most of the franchise, it takes a very slow approach to building up momentum.  Even AVP sort of "drops the hammer" as opposed to the slow burning fire of Requiem.  Adding the new Predator-Xenomorph really changees the movie, both mechanically and plot-wise.

Aesthetics:  90
	The Predator based Xenomorph (especially that it's technically a queen) is amazing, and the visuals around its birthing process are more than sufficiently creepy.  The setting of a small town both gives us the idea of what these creatures would be like taking over the planet and finally expands the experience to something larger than jigsaw type group trap.  All the same CG and practical effect qualities from the first movie apply to the sequel and then some.  Having the Wolf (the Predator who comes to Terra) even allows for a little interplanetary travel.
	
Storyline:  85
	There isn't much of a story past the premise: a Predator-Xenomorph crashes on Terra and infects a little town in Colorado.  Having the Wolf come in to allows for the barest amount of actual plot as he investigates and attempts to exterminate the infestation.  The humans surviving the incident almost seems like more of an unwanted by product to the main plot, and still the story, the infestation, is all constructed as an engaging, entertaining piece of movie.
	
Character Development:  51
	This barely passes the development bar: Wolf grows as he investigates and fights this new prey, but the most development the humans have is the spoil rich blonde girl that decides it's better not to bang a psychopath and maybe a guy that is obsessed with her.
	
Compulsion:  92
	The movie is interesting from start to finish.  I love the strategic elements of puzzling out how to survive this situation, and the Predator-Xenomorph is fascinating.  This is definitely my favoritie Predator situation and the most interesting Xenomorph movie I've seen.
	
Final Score:  79.5
