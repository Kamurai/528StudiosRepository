#ScaryMovieSquad Review:
Predator

Format: Live Action
Applicable Settings: Modern
Applicable Genre: Horror, Science Fiction, Suspense

Hit or Skip:  Skip!
	As classic as it may be, ultimately the pacing is off and it ruins the investment for me.

General:
	I got bored with all 3 acts of this movie: the guerilla act, the hunted act, and the hunting act.  I honestly don't know what the disconnect is unless it's that the Predator is presented as a beatable foe with the air of indomittable monster.

Aesthetics:  80
	While invisibility CG is a favorite of mine, this was really before it was good.  That combined with the goofy looking practicals makes the predator more funny that menacing.  The unidentifiable jungle is also a bad setting as you can't tell how far anyone gets to run, and there is zero investiment in trying to track where anything is happening.  The action is well laid out and somewhat exciting.  The thermal vision is a fun way to play with the visuals.
	
Storyline:  51
	What story?  There was a story about this CIA guy that tricked these soldiers into the jungle that gets abandonded for the "We're being hunted" action.  From there it's "we fought, we won, let's go get a burger".  That said, the action toybox part of the movie is laid out well, until the suspense toybox kicks in and the pace slows to a crawl as they hunt each other.
	
Character Development:  30
	It's really hard to do character development when most of your cast is dead.  Arnold, the nameless lady, and the predator get the lion's share, but it's mostly survival / hunting development.
	
Compulsion:  49
	This is just on the underside of interesting enough for me.  It feels silly that a human would be able to evenly go hand to hand with a Predator, the Predators obviously don't see in thermal naturally, and how long would it take for the Predator to give up or move on once it can't find him?
	
Final Score:  52.5
