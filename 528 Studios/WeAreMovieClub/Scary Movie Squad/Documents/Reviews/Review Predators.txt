#ScaryMovieSquad Review:
Predators

Format: Live Action
Applicable Settings: Modern
Applicable Genre: Horror, Science Fiction, Action

Hit or Skip:  Skip!
	Despite several points that should make this more interesting, I don't think this lands.

General:
	Despite several vast improvements, the movie doesn't quite get to where I want it to be.  Having several Predators, with tech advantage, and animal assistance makes the movie feel ridiculously one sided despite the humans being armed up.  Really this is a convoluted version of Saw 2 with everyone stuck in a death trap, but with all the nuasances revealed.

Aesthetics:  85
	They took a return to formula of using the forest as a setting, but making it as distinctive as they did the city in the 2nd movie.  The invisibility cg has gotten immensly better by this point, and there are several details in the scenes and creatures that make the movie pop at points.
	
Storyline:  51
	They're (literally) dropped onto a planet to be hunted, they're hunted, they fight back and a couple of them make it through alive, but don't escape the planet.  Barely enough of a story.
	
Character Development:  51
	Each person is pretty much the stereotype that they are found with.  I literally just referred to them as Leader, Minigun, Sniper, African.  The only twists were the Predators fighting one another, and the Doctor thinking he understood Predator culture at all.
	
Compulsion:  60
	There we some great moments of spectacle throughout the movie, but most of the interest in the movie was puzzling out how they could survive and what to do in the situation.  The results didn't do much for me.
	
Final Score:  61.75
