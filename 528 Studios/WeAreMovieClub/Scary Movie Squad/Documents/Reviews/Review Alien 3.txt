#ScaryMovieSquad Review:
Alien 3

Format: Live Action
Applicable Settings: Modern
Applicable Genre: Horror, Science Fiction, Creature Feature

Hit or Skip:  Skip!
	Unless you're just working your way through the franchise, there are better Alien movies to watch.

General:
	I can't fully recommend this as it just doesn't feel as exciting as the other movies.  Across the board, this movie could have done better in almost every aspect.  I would love to see this movie rebooted though as it had a lot of potential, even committing the idea of the prison.

Aesthetics:  80
	While its interesting to see more xenomorphs from the start of the situation, the prison offers so little good scenery, and there isn't really an option of the planet surface.  Having so little equipment available restricts the number of cool battle scenes and the kill scenes weren't very good.  I will say that the xenomorphs look pretty good in this, especially playing with the liquid lead in the foundry.
	
Storyline:  75
	Everything that made Ripley a symbolistic wife/mother is taken from her and thus she's taken from empowered hero to weak villain.  It almost feels like the writer is trying to say something: something that isn't all that interesting.
	
Character Development:  85
	Ripley is thrown back to the bottom rung of the ladder, the rapists are only detered by lethal violence.  The authority is so strict that it gets eaten instead of believe in alternatives.  The saving of it is that they realize through sacrifice they can make a difference.
	
Compulsion:  75
	It takes far too long to "slow burn" and a ridiculous amount of misinformation and disbelief about the situation when people are clearly dead and it should be obvious they were mauled.  Having the cast be unarmed prisoners doesn't help the situation be very interesting.
	
Final Score:  78.75
