#ScaryMovieSquad Review:
The Descent

Format: Live Action
Applicable Settings: Modern
Applicable Genre: Horror, Action

Hit or Skip:  Hit!
	One of my favorite horror movies.

General:
	I love this movie; it is intense.  It hits that special spot for me where it's a real life situation that goes sideways and they've got to figure out how to survive it.  On top of that they get the supernatural / mythical obstacles of the Wendigo on top of that.  The final pin is that they actually have a realistic chance at survival, it's not like aliens are going to glass the planet.

Aesthetics:  98
	You may not have a clue how hard it must have been to shoot in that cave system, let alone churn out such a good movie.  The creatures are fantastic, the rock climbing is all done well, and the sound and situations are all extremely immersive.  The details on the injuries and stealth actions really bring the movie to life in a way I wouldn't have thought was possible.
	
Storyline:  90
	This movie has a slow build up, that is well done, minus Sarah's really unnecessary backstory.  I really don't see the point of gathering sympathy for her for that long.  There are much shorter way to established she's medicated and potentially crazy.  But as soon as the movie actually starts (at the cave in) the movie is wonderfully paced and written into this wonderful branching and merging storylines for each of the ladies.
	
Character Development:  90
	Honestly, they didn't do a great job of establishing the characters: it was only when they talked about who was where that I actually knew most of them.  This is a good sign that everyone is going to die, as writers don't like investing in characters that are going to die, despite it resulting in uneventful deaths.  Surpringly, the scenes are so intense and the setting so bizarre it almost feels like we're watching found footage when we're not.  Watching Sarah go through the (unecessary) backstory and watching her become, and even Juno as they survive is fantastic.
	
Compulsion:  94
	This movie has a great pace with slow build up and intense scenes where I can wait to see what's happening next.  The "Wendigos" or whatever are great design, visually and behaviorally: they're terrifying but manageable.  Their real threat is their numbers and the cave system itself.  It's great to see Sarah and Juno be such bad asses in this, and I'm honestly excited for the sequel.
	
Final Score:  93
