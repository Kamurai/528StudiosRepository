Cockpit
	the listening to a "black box" recording from the lost ship, the "Event Horizon"
	
Approach
	plenty of turbulence
									they are travel at ridiculous speeds on approach
									could have just coasted in
	they clamp onto something that is not supposed to hold a ship to dock
	
	they ready a boarding party
	
Boarding
	they go through a flimsy connection tube
	they use magnetic boots
	they mechanically override the locks
		pressure spits stuff up the flimsy "umbilicle" tube
		
Event Horizon
	they split up to cover ground

			the point is to split the ship
			using the foreward part of the ship as a "lifeboat"
			
	medical
		it's empty
		except for a floating arm / glove
		
	engineering
		the door is a weird iris
		the walkway to engineering is a weird, bladed, spinning tunnel
		
	cockpit
		part of it is lined with liquified meat
		she goes to recover a cd
		spins / runs into a "corpsicle"
		
	Engineering
		"I'm getting some really strange readings in here"
		goes to turn the power on
			the "gravity drive" core is a spinning sphere with 3 rings around it
			
		the core aligns and "opens"
			comms go dead
			sort of blinds Justin
			he PUTS HIS FINGER IN IT
				THEN HIS HAND
					SOMETHING PULLS HIM IN

		there is an explosion (or shockwave)
			electricity happens
			fires start
			crew are thrown about
			there are even fires on their ship (Lewis and Clark)
				along with hull breaches
			
			the remaining crew evactuates to the Event Horizon

	cockpit
		they're screwed, basically
			running out of air
			no comms
			severe hull damage

		doc and cooper argue about the "gateway being open"
		
	Engineering
		Dr. Weir tries to explain to the Capt and XO about the gate

										we don't get a lot of answers here
										
		"if you could see the things I've seen, you wouldn't try to stop me"
		he activates a timed opening of the outer door
			he sort of "wakes up"
			he begs them to open the door
