Scary Movie Squad: Quarantine

Opens on footage for a firehouse documentary.

	firehouse is stupid for this
		it just pads the runtime
		it helps with the premise, maybe
		they could really be anywhere before the complex
		
arrive at the complex
	silly messy medical call
	grandma is crazy
		but talking coherently, if eradict
		
	Cop gets bit
	they all get locked in the building
	fireman falls to his death
	
Grandma kills another lady
	cop shoots her
	
They take attendence by grouping everyone downstairs
						this is actually a pretty good strategy
							but they don't barricade or segregate potential infected
							
Lady watching static and growling
	SHE'S FOAMING AT THE MOUTH
		they take her downstairs
		
							no communication from the CDC except "do not leave the building"
							
Army took up positions outside the building to keep them back.
	
							the firefighters know what rabies is, but don't secure the foaming lady
							
BNC threat declared
	radios and cell phones don't work
	little girl has a fever
							she should be isolated as well as the foaming lady
							
They attempt to sneak out the 2nd floor office window
	the army is there to stop them
	plastic sheeting is put over the windows
	
They happen to have a doctor (a vet), he looks at the injured.
	HE DOESN'T RECOGNIZE RABIES YET
	
almost dead fireman walks on his broken leg
	vet finally recognizes rabies in 3 people in the room
					can we isolate them yet?
	little dog ran off
	
they go off to explore
	they run into a big dog
	elevator comes up and the dog mauls the guy in there
	
they go somewhere else
	they find the foaming lady
	camera guy beats her to death with the first person camera
	
They finally group everyone in a somewhat secure room
	this includes the wounded
	
							Do you be honest with people, or do you tell the truth (in or out of the building) and potentially insight panic?
							
	They discuss rabies some more
	
CDC comes in
	they show the CDC around
	CDC reacts to the camera guy turning on a light

CDC take over the patient room
	crew sneaks about to record the CDC taking a brain sample
	fireman attacks the doctor after
	
they talk about the infection starting from a dog
	they figure out the girl is infected
	she attacks mom and runs off
	mom is defending her still
							why?
							
they look for the girl
	cop turns his head, he gets bit
	they run
	more running
	lots of running
	no one is attempting to fight the infected and control the situation
	
they go to another office
	the latina lady is bleeding
	her dude attempts to go out the window
		he gets shot
	building manager starts talking about another way out
		he gets attacked through a glass door
								where did THAT go?
											I can't keep track of shit for locations
											
they go to the elevator
	fireman is kicking ass
	she's lost her mind
	camera guy is still there
	
elevator stops

		she's panicking
	firedude SNAPS HER NECK
									I finally remember this is found footage

	she gets thrown over the edge
	
									the pacing is crazy unbalanced
	
fire dude gets bit by the building managers
									kill the infected!
other two escape to the....top floor

they find patient zero
