#ScaryMovieSquad Review:
Alien: Covenant

Format: Live Action
Applicable Settings: Modern
Applicable Genre: Horror, Science Fiction

Hit or Skip:  Hit!
	This is probably the movie everyone was expecting when Prometheous was released.

General:
	While this is a great origin story for the traditional xenomorph that we love to hate, it feels like this movie is full of double edge swords.  It's cool to have more androids, but they look the same so it's disorienting (by design), we get to see a newly habitable planet, but there is xenomorphic spores, we have a crew bright enough to travel through space and terraform a planet, but they can't perform their jobs well enough to be safe.  Thankfully, horror movies are fueled by stupid.

Aesthetics:  90
	There is some great CG for the neo/xeno morphs and face huggers, and Engineer scenes.  They even did a good job with the androids, not only did they manage to do a decent missing hand, but when Fassbender was kung fu fighting Fassbender, it was done surprisingly well.  I had some issues with the ship designs, but the planet looks great and each scene feels like how it should for the scene.
	
Storyline:  40
	I actually like the ending, but the fact that the android is a homicidal maniac in the first place still bothers me.  The characters are so stupid for most of the movie there's not much plot to concentrate on.  It really is a continuation of David's story and it sucks, I hate that android.  I'm realising the actual lack of plot hear other than humans to planet, humans to android, aliens to humans, aliens to ship.  This is actually a good example of a movie that is good because it supports other movies.
	
Character Development:  40
	As much as I should be complaining that all the humans are underdeveloped (even the ones for which we did have development had worthless exposition), with the lack of story it doesn't matter past the point that the audience has no investment in their deaths.  My biggest investment reaction to a death in the movie was, "Ohhh, the hot girl died......well, get her head out of the water".  At the same time, building off of the last movie, David is overdeveloped to the point of being boring, and the Engineers (who aren't really in the story) even go some development to accent the android's.
	
Compulsion:  70
	I remember liking the movie: it's cool to see the action, the aliens, the origins, but half of the movie is built off the first, some of the rest is built from traditional xenomorphs.  But it is fun to see these idiots try to survive the movie.
	
Final Score:  60
