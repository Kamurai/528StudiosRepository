The Concessionaires Must Die!

Format: Live Action
Applicable Settings: Modern
Applicable Genres: Comedy, Nerd, Romantic

Hit or Skip:  Hit!
	A fun nerd rom com if ever there was one.

General:
	A multi-threaded story about movies, love, life and business.  For those willing to look a little deeper, there are definitely metaphor and references to find, but the idea behind the movie itself is doing a job that you love, whether its on either side of the war between small business and corporations.  It's actually a lovely premise
	
Aesthetics:  80
	For a small budget movie that takes place mostly in a theater, there are some surprisingly good visuals here, and having the narrator die during the movie is a nice touch, even if there isn't too much audience investment in the narrator.  
	
Storyline:  85
	The story of the everyman fighting to save what they love, and it's even done Clerks style, being about a bunch of layabouts that want to work at a place with their friends talking movies and social trends.  From an antagonist perspective, the story is a little anti-climatic and the backstory to Derek's insanity being the one thing I would cut from this movie shows how weak sauce of a villain I think he is.  While the ending is a little Deus Ex "Boss"ina, in the moment it feels really good in the scene.
	
Character Development:  85
	It feels like almost every speaking character in the movie, other than America Young herself, has their own developmental story.  They're not all very moving or powerful, but they're all there and well balanced throughout the movie.  Of course Ashley and Scott have the lion's share, being the bangable Dante and Randall of the movie, and poor Gabby is a pendulum of insanity.  Derek's pretty much crazy from start to finish, but he basically drives everyone else to brand new lives.
	
Compulsion:  90
	The bottom line is that for fans of movies, this is a fun movie about great characters.  It's well written, produced and presented with a great flavored from its cast.  They really bring the characters to life in such goofy scenarios and relatable relationships.
	
Final Score:  85
