Notes: Murder on the Orient Express

Opens on a middle eastern (?) desert city
	the wailing wall in Jerusalem
	
	kid is running a box of eggs to...a restaraunt
	
	a guy refuses them
	
	he wants them to be perfect
		he measures them to see if they have even height
		
	the other implores him for a miracle
		
Outside
	he steps in shit
		so he has to step in it with the other shoe
			so they're even
			
	the guy is participating in some sort of trial
		he found a clue like sherlock holmes style
		
	he accuses the chief of police
		he's actually guilty
																Hercule Peroire is derivative of Sherlock Holmes
																
Ferry
	He meets a black guy
	He meets a redhead
	
	they all go to Istanbul
	
Some bakery
	Peroire meets an old friend and his prostitute
		he mentions the Orient Express
		
	another man shows up with a telegram
		Peroire deduces it's a case
																there is a lot of establishing shots here
																	maybe because it's from a book
																	
	we get to see several characters that must be involved in the mystery
		none of their actions are particularly relevant
		they show bits of their character
		
Train
	Peroire runs into an older lady that seems to want to get laid
	Characters try to get situated on the train
	
	there is quite a bit of nothing happening as character run across each other
		this is obviously to establish who the murder suspects might be
		
	
	Johnny Depp tries to hire Perro for a job
		to "watch his back", he thinks he's going to be murder
			Perro repeatedly declines
				"I do not like your face"
				
Night
	train man comes for Mr. Ratchet (johnny depp)
		Perro notices
		Mr. Ratchet does not answer
		
	the train seems to derail
		or at least it stops, unable to continue

Day		
	the train representative is waiting on the next trainstation master to send a rescue time
	
	Perro breaks into Mr. Ratchet's room
		he's apparently dead
		
	the train representative implores Perro to find the killer
		they must still be on the train, as it is stuck
		
	They announce Mr. Ratchet's murder
		people start giving alibis and clues
		Perro announces himself as the world's best detective
			he quarantines the guests to the dining car
	
	
Drunk Josh Gad
	Perro interviews a drunk Josh Gad
		as he was the closest person to Mr. Ratchet on the train
		
Murder scene
	Perro investigates the murder scene
		12 stab wounds
		watch stopped at 1:15 (AM)
		
		He notes it's odd that Mr. Ratchet seemed so unresponsive
																						most likely poisoned first
			and did not use his gun
				which they confinscate
	
	rescue team shows up
		they set up in a tunnel within 100 meters ahead of the train
																						the train is shown
																							it seems to be simply lodged in an excessive amount of snow
																							
Flashback
	Perro notes that Mr. Ratchet is actually someone else
		Cassetti, murderer of an Armstrong family member
	
Dining Car
	Horny lady swears the murderer started in her room and went to Ratchet's through the adjoining door
	
	Perro continues interviews with train passengers
	
	Penelope Cruz is apparently the last person to see Mr. Ratchet alive
		he pulled a gun on her
		
Outside
	he interviews Daisy Ridley outside
	
Inside
	Lady Dench gets interviewed in what looks like her private car
		she reveals she has connections to the Armstrongs
		
	he interviews the help in German
		the hankerchief is not hers
		she identifies an extra train conductor
			they find something in Perro's suitcase
			they find the contraband uniform in the help's room
			it matches a button they have
			
Outside
	they notice someone running
	Perro pursues
		it's the drunk Josh Gad
		
		they apprehend him
		
Inside
	they accuse Josh Gad of stealing from Ratchet
		he confesses to such
		but not to murder
		
	the black doctor speaks on his behalf
	
	the horny lady gets stabbed
	
Dining car
	everyone decides to sleep in the dining car
	
somewhere else
	some young lady takes barbits to sleep
		this links her to the murder
		
		she's trying to hide her name as "Elena"
		when it's her hankerchief, "Helena"
		
	Perro outs a former police officer that has been lying to him repeatedly
	
Next day
	everyone deboards while they get the train engine back on the tracks
	
	Perro accuses Daisy Ridley
		she admits her motive
		but the black doctor shoots Perro
			and claims the blame
			
			he changed the watch time 
				to change the time of death
			
	As he's about to shoot Perro
		the train engine rights and shifts the car
		Perro fights his way out
		the train rep saves him
		
Outside
	Perro doesn't believe the black doctor is the killer
		he continues to look for the beneficary
		
	Perro ends up accusing them ALL of the murder
		the "horny lady" (Michelle Pfieffer) takes credit for masterminding it
		she claims they all took a turn at stabbing him
		
	Perro offers them an out
		to kill him, put him in the lake
			then they can all walk away
			
	Michell Pfieffer tries to kill him
		no bullets
		
....no idea what the fuck actual happened

Perro deboards
	someone is waiting to take him to Egypt to solve a murder
