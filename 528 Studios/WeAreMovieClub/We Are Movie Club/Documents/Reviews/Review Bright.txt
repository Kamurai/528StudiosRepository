#WeAreMovieClub Review: Bright
Format: Live Action
Applicable Genres: Action
Applicable Settings: Dystopian, Science Fiction, Fantasy


Hit or Skip:  Hit!

General:
	If you've ever head of Shadowrun, this is a Shadowrun movie and while it feels super irrelevant now to have a Shadowrun movie, they certainly gave it the budget to do it well.

Aesthetics:  90
	In a complex way that looks simple, the movie uses makeup to distinguish not only races, but demographics and culture.  The movie is well scored and technology and music are utilized well to demonstrate what the world is about.  The special and pratical effects are very well done and the sets are dressed well.

Storyline:  80
	This particular storyline sort of depends on the audience already knowing a bit about the Shadowrun world, the real rarity of a wand, and the existing conflicts between all the races.  I'm honestly still a little foggy on a lot of that, what the movie wanted me to know aside.  The given story on its own is a good concept and an exercise in morality.

Character Development:  80
	Again, the movie seems to relie heavily on a previous knowledge of racial stereotypes for a fictional world, but ultimately we're seeing a growth of morality over greed and a sense of togetherness as a world community in spite of growth in power.  Whether literally or socially.

Compulsion:  80
	The movie seems more interesting than fun, but it have a little something for everyone except a full on romance thread.  There is a good balance of focus on the overall story and small character quips to keep you engaged, but I don't feel like we're properly indoctrinated into why we should care, or it it leans on things in real life that I'm not associating.

Final Score:  87.75
	This is a fun, entertaining movie.  While I don't think it would necessarily win an award, it should entertain you and all your guests.
