#WeAreMovieClub Review:
Guardians of the Galaxy

Format: Live Action
Applicable Genres: Modern
Applicable Settings: Comics, Sci-Fi, Action

Hit or Skip:  Hit!
	A ridiculously lovable group of anti-heroes makes it worth the watch.

General:
	This is a fun trip back and forth across the line of morality.  To date, this is the most enjoyable Marvel to me.  I can even watch it back to back.
	
Aesthetics:  95
	If you like spaceships, there is plenty to enjoy here on dogfights and space scenes alone.  The epic looking characters, great action sequence and fantastic score are really what makes the movie as fun as it is.  Being true sci-fi, they definitely push the bounds of technology and use the variation races to build not only a diversified cast of character, but an entire universe that feels natural and stupendous.
	
Storyline:  92
	This movie is all, very subtly, about what's good or bad.  The question of if a one is out for oneself or out for the greater good, and with Ronan's obsession of bringing Zandar to "justice" is the perfect villian's quandry.  From Ronan's perspective he is not the villain, he's saving the Kree Empire and the galaxy from the corruption of Zandar so it becomes a collision of morality where 2 factions have competing views.  Presenting this in such a fashion that is never actually discussed, but presented as a conflict in the movie and resolved through might.
	
Character Development:  95
	Every character involved is looking for a better life / world: more money, adventure, revenge, redemption which they use to become galactic heroes.  While the movie itself plays with the idea of what is good or bad, the characters all wrestle with their morals to be a better person in the end.  Each character is crafted to be interesting on its own and play off the other characters amazingly thorughout the movie that the movie feels constantly fresh.
	
Compulsion:  98
	Each actor embodies their character perfectly, and each character expresses themselves amazingly.  I love disfunctional family comedy and this fits that almost perfectly; combined with sci-fi and asymmetrical sides, this movie reaches me in unexpected places of joy and I look forward to watching it again.
	
Final Score:  95
