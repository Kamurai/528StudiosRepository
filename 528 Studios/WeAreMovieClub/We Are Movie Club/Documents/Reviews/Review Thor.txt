#WeAreMovieClub Review:
Thor

Format: Live Action
Applicable Genres: Modern
Applicable Settings: Comics, Sci-Fi, Fantasy, Action

Hit or Skip:  Hit!
	Like many of the Marvel movies, there a few scenes make the movie worth the watch on their own.

General:
	
	
Aesthetics:  92
	The Jotun fight, the blue skin, the Sentinel/Destroyer robot, and just Thor wandering around like a crazy person all make this worth a watch and an enjoyable view.
	
Storyline:  88
	There honestly isn't too much to the story of this one.  It mostly Loki creating twists for the protagonists.  Thor's banishment to earth in the movie (and probably the comics) was enough of a story without Loki manipulating the situation further, and ultimately was probably his downfall, almost like he wanted to get caught.
	
Character Development:  90
	Thor re-learning how to Thor, or learning how to be loved by daddy, is a great watch.  Even on the mortal realm, he's a hell of a fighter and Hemsworth really embodies the character well.
	
Compulsion:  88
	Natalie Portman, Hemsworth and the rest of the cast are funny, and the action is great.  This even has the first peek at Hawkeye in the MCU.  I'm not necessarily a big fan of Thor in general, but I can't deny that this is good watch.
	
Final Score:  90
	Watch, enjoy, get some back story on your current favorite MCU crossovers.
