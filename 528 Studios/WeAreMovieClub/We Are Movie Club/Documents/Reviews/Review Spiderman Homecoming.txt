#WeAreMovieClub Review:
Spiderman Homecoming

Format: Live Action
Applicable Genres: Modern
Applicable Settings: Comics, Sci-Fi, Action

Hit or Skip:  Hit!
	It's great to really feel Spiderman in Tom Holland's performance

General:
	While I'll probably maintain this is actually Ironman 4, the is a good Spiderman movie buried under Tony Stark and the dellusions of grandeure that don't belong in a Spiderman story.
	
Aesthetics:  85
	There are some great looking scenes in this, but even the climatic fight scenes are more funny than epic.  Spiderman running through backyards (why?) like Ferris Bueller was a much more grabbing scene than where he webs the Ferry together and does the classic Jesus Christ Spiderman bit.  For what it is worth, the Vulture is done very well, and Michael Keaton himself is a master actor in body language, making a ride to the Homecoming dance exceedingly creepy.
	
Storyline:  82
	The Spiderman plot of this is simply Peter trying to keep some of the left over Chitari tech out of his neighborhood and possibly put an arms dealer away.  The overwhelming Stark storyline is Tony interfering in Spiderman's life and basically giving him a light-weight Ironman suit and stringing him along with the idea that'll he'll get to be something that Tony won't every let him really be.
	
Character Development:  90
	This is a rollercoaster of emotion and development.  We see a father turn crime boss after the government steals a payday, we see a hero of the people begging to leave it all behind for the next taste of fighting amongst gods and monsters, but doesn't have the responsibility to secure his backpacks when he goes on patrol.  Seeing the friendly neighborhood Spiderman is so enjoyable, I can almost forget what a wiener baby he is about having the unnecessary advantages from Stark.
	
Compulsion:  85
	The movie is filled with fun and a wonderful performance by Tom Holland.  While the involvement of Stark does bother me, it doesn't detract from it being enjoyable.  After all, it is Spiderman experiencing the adventure, and Tom embodies Spiderman fairly well.
	
Final Score:  85.5
