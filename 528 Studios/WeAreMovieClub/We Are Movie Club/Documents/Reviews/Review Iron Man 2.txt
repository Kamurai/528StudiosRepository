#WeAreMovieClub Review:
Iron Man 2

Format: Live Action
Applicable Genres: Modern
Applicable Settings: Comics, Sci-Fi, Action

Hit or Skip:  Skip!
	It's good to see Tony taken down a peg.

General:
	I like seeing Tony go against a villain with a more personal vendetta than just minor jealousy.  Ivan feels real loss, real rage, and uses similar tech to Tony's to go at him.  One better, Tony actually gives Ivan advice on how to kill him better.
	
Aesthetics:  92
	We get to see some great sets, the Droids are a lot of fun, and introducing War Machine creates some great scenes.  Ivan's designs on the arc reactor technology are extremely eye catching, for the short amount of time they are on screen.  I also love the compact suitcase suit that Tony uses on the racetrack.
	
Storyline:  85
	Ivan hunting down Tony for his father's death is a substantial story, and Hammer's involvement, while filled with shallow jealousy, serves to extend Ivan's story in a way.
	
Character Development:  88
	The paladium sub-story in this is interesting, but more for the fact of make Tony seem more grounded and human again.  It also allows for character development with Romanov and SHIELD as well as backstory on the Starks.
	
Compulsion:  85
	Ivan is just by far a more interesting villain than in the first movie.  While Hammer definitely is not, him funding Ivan allows for some fun scenes amongst a lot of drama of Tony dealing with his mortality.
	
Final Score:  87.5
