#WeAreMovieClub Review:
Iron Man 3

Format: Live Action
Applicable Genres: Modern
Applicable Settings: Comics, Sci-Fi, Action

Hit or Skip:  Skip!
	The best of this is seeing Tony shaken.

General:
	While I personally enjoy the early version of the Iron Legion via the House Party protocol, the thing that makes this movie anything is that Tony is dealing with his PTSD from "The Avengers" and realizing that he's just a meat sac compared with gods, The Hulk, aliens, and a literal Super Soldier.  After all Iron Man operates from a point of Technological superiority and very rarely puts his life on the line.
	
Aesthetics:  94
	The glowy fire people, the modular suit, and general mayhem of dealing with PTSD creates some great and powerful scenes.  Rhodes even points out that it doesn't look good for Tony outside the restaraunt, and that helps make it that powerful moment of a "super hero" being a vulnerable.  My absolute favorite is the multiple suits flying about during the last scene.
	
Storyline:  80
	I like a good love story mixed in, but it sort of cheapens Killain's plot if it's all about a girl he couldn't get before he was hot.  The villainy plot is actually well done, except for the involvement of the Mandarin: AIM is good enough of a villainous organization to use, and they're not spies they're scientists.
	
Character Development:  88
	There is a boat load of development with Tony working through his PTSD.  We see some very fast dev with Pepper adapting to the botany magic serum, and we even get a little bit as an audience through Iron Patriat and Mandarin: getting to question how we behave as a society.
	
Compulsion:  88
	It makes it interesting to see an organization of people that go toe to toe with Iron Man to the point where Tony actually  feels he needs a small army to deal with them.
	
Final Score:  87.5
