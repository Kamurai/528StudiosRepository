#WeAreMovieClub Review:
The Incredible Hulk (2008)

Format: Live Action
Applicable Genres: Modern
Applicable Settings: Comics, Sci-Fi, Action

Hit or Skip:  Hit!
	While not as good as Avengers Hulk, this is when Hulk got good.

General:
	Despite the disappointing prequel to this movie, they found a way to sell Banner and more importantly, sell Hulk as than just a monster.  Whether they sold him as a metaphor or a hero, I don't care: Banner super heroed more in this movie than Iron Man did in 3, and was twice as entertaining.
	
Aesthetics:  97
	The CG for the Hulk is great, the action (to include the audio) is impressive and immersive.  With well constructed scenes, extreme details on Banner, Hulk, and the Abomination, and even Mr. Blue, they definitely put the effort into making a proper spectacle of the movie.
	
Storyline:  94
	Other than the premise that the Army has to hunt and provoke Banner into destroying everything, the plot actually does a great job of selling Banner as a man battling his inner monster and not making him look like a coward as he runs away as much as possible.  It takes some very stupid plot points to propel the story forward, but the majority of the movie is centered in either very heavy emotional plot points or massive destruction from the battles.
	
Character Development:  95
	Bruce struggling to gain control IS the Hulk, and there is plenty of it.  Seeing him turn from offense to defense over Betty as the Hulk is fantastic: it's part of the extended Hero's Journey that Bruce is on, and while he rides that refusal a long, long way, seeing him start to accept who he is in the final act and be a hero is wonderful and adds weight to the final fight.
	
Compulsion:  92
	While Edward Norton isn't the perfect Bruce Banner, he manages to do very well despite a lack of actual science at play.  Whether it the emotinally driven story, fantastically crafted action scenes, or tiny detailed comedic bits between character, the movie is 2+ hours of great entertainment and leaves you ready for more.
	
Final Score:  94.5
