#WeAreMovieClub Review:
Iron Man

Format: Live Action
Applicable Genres: Modern
Applicable Settings: Comics, Sci-Fi, Action

Hit or Skip:  Skip!
	I'm just not a Tony Stark fan.

General:
	I'm admittedly not a fan of Tony Stark, he's an alcholic, womanizing, drug user, capitalist, and borderline sociopath.  It honestly makes me sad when kids want to be Iron Man. Watching a re-imagining of the origin of a monster turned armed redemption seeker is awkward at best.  The movie has its good points, but it feels riddle with bad as well.
	
Aesthetics:  90
	They managed to do a lot with bare desert, and a cave for most of the movie.  Tony's a good character for living in presentation mode as happens before he is taken.  His workshop is oddly captivating and the Iron Man suit is eye catching in almost any point in the movie.
	
Storyline:  80
	Granted this was the first story to "popularize" comicbook movies again, but this is also where the "Marvel Mirror" began as well: when a "super hero" fights a mirrored version of himself as some kind of metaphor for us fighting our inner demons.
	
Character Development:  85
	Iron Man does very little "super heroing" in his own movies.  He defends himself, he kills militia groups in another country (technically this is participating in a war), but not really much of saving people that aren't collateral damage against him.  But going through the adversity in the movie to create the Iron Man suit is something.
	
Compulsion:  75
	I don't like the reimagining of Iron Man being created in the early 2000s: I would have honestly preferred that Iron Man be an established super hero already during the same time period.  I'm not sure I would have preferred the origin of Iron Man being set in 1963, but I would have much preferred we stay out of caves and deserts and actually battled a someone who was an actual problem, like maybe the Hulk?
	
Final Score:  82.5
