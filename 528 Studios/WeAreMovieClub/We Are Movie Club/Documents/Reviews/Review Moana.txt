#WeAreMovieClub Review: Moana

Hit or Skip:  Hit!

General:
	Another great Disney movie filled with catchy songs and lovable characters.  I'd be honestly surprised if anyone watched this and did not love it.

Aesthetics:  99
	The water physics are truly amazing and are so throughout the entire movie.  Just watching a character be enveloped with water is fanscinating.  The movie is filled with great detail such as Maui's tatoos, the foilage, but even just Moana's (and Maui's) hair is rendered with extreme care.  There are also so many catchy and well crafted songs throughout the movie, you're bound to find yourself singing one of them later.

Storyline:  90
	Its interesting to see Disney lift another mythical story from open source material.  As far as I have been able to tell, they've stayed pretty close the source material and could potentially give us more from this pool of stories, especially since this was 10 times the story that Hercules was.

Character Development:  88
	While I'm thoroughly upset that we don't get more on Pua, this is a great coming of age story for Moana, we see her grow and develope discipline throughout the movie, even extending some of that to Maui, Hey Hey, and even her father.

Compulsion:  95
	Almost every scene in this movie is either fun or moving.  There are so few problems I have with this movie, I can barely imagine people not enjoying themselves during this movie.

Final Score:  93
	This is a catchy movie, fun for the whole family.  You'll find yourself singing and watching more.
