#WeAreMovieClub Review:
Captain America: Civil War

Format: Live Action
Applicable Genres: Modern
Applicable Settings: Comics, Sci-Fi, Action


Hit or Skip:  Hit!
	Everyone should see this at least once, then rewatch the epic fight scenes.

General:
	While it might have some small problems, as a stand alone action movie its a riot: full of spectacle, humor, and beauty.
	
Aesthetics:  94
	This movie is FILLED with badass action sequences that are worth watching on repeat, muted even.  With the special effects and the situational humor, its hard not to love this without hating violence all together.
	
Storyline:  88
	The plot can't really decide what it wants to be.  There is a glorious Winter Soldier movie in hidden that's mucked down with the Avengers...not really having a war.  The story really takes a backseat to the spectacle.
	
Character Development:  88
	Nemo is a lame villain that almost no one recognizes, and as he develops he and the story suffers.  The psychological adventures of Tony, Steve, Rhodey, Bucky, Wanda, and even Vision and Peter are interesting.  The bigger picture of friend fighting friend, and even friends imprisoned is super interesting.
	
Compulsion:  90
	This movie is fun, once the action get started, it'll carry you away until something stupid happens.  The dip is just enough to make almost anything happening interesting and then they ratchet it to 11.
	
Final Score:  90
	No matter how much I bitch about how "Its not like the comics", this is a good watch, and about half the movie is worth watching 3 times.
