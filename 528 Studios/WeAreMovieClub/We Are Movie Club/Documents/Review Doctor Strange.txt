Format: Live Action
Applicable Settings: Modern
Applicable Genres: Comics, Action, Fantasy, Scifi, Science Fiction

Hit or Skip:  Hit!
	Most of the movie is actually pretty funny.

General:
	Its actually pretty fun to see Marvel take a character I found boring in the comics, start him as a jerk that rivals Tony Stark and Hank Pym and slowly grow him into someone I just don't care about.  The guy's biggest acomplishment is breaking magical law, seemingly so he could brag that he outdid everyone as he did as a medical professional, and to top it all off he's rewarded by becoming the magical sheriff of Terra.
	
Aesthetics:  95
	The movie is incredibly produced, and the magical world morphing is insanely detailed and thought out.  I LOVE cinematic rewinding, and they even threw in forward motion with it.  As fantastic as the light bending is, I wildly prefer the transparent weapons of the villains to any of the orange sparkling nonsense that occurs throughout almost all their magic.  The astral projection was especially interesting, but I don't think anything beats Rachel McAdams scared by a broom.
	
Storyline:  55
	For a Marvel movie, this story is laughably poor.  The first half of the movie could be replaced with "A jerk Doctor traveled to Nepal to heal his broken hands." and then show him getting his ass beat on the street.  Even from there, the establishing scenes are that he's brilliant by near impossible to deal with, and as they have to deal with him less, he progresses quickly.  The story barely starts when Kaecilius attacks, and then it's basically a series of fights where the first climax is punctuated with the unresolved death of a major character and the second climax is essentially an overhyped conversation.
	
Character Development:  70
	There is so much wasted effort put into Strange being a jerk, there is more value in the little development of The Ancient Once than him.  Mordo's development is probably the strongest in the movie, and you might not even realize the extent of it without seeing an after credits scene.  Ultimately the character of Doctor Strange becomes, but it feels like it's out of obligation and not heroism.
	
Compulsion:  90
	This movie is surprisingly funny throughout the movie.  Rachel McAdams, and so much of the other cast, is a treat, and Benedict Cumberbatch honestly portrays the character wonderfully.  Everything that is put in front of the audience is pretty great, I just question why some of it is being put in front of the audience.
	
Final Score:  77.5
