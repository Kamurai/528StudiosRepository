#WeAreMovieClub Review:
Black Panther

Format: Live Action
Applicable Settings: Modern
Applicable Genres: Action, Comics, Science Fiction

Hit or Skip:  Hit!
	Everyone should see it for the visual spectacle alone.

General:
	Overall, it's a good movie, but is just followed with so much hype that it couldn't live to it.
	
Aesthetics:  96
	This movie looks great, it has fantastic special effects, and even CG Battle Rhinos!  The nanite suits and holo-printed technology is amazing and actually works for what they want it to do.  The movie is able to deliver wild, fantastical things in a funny and engaging manner.  I honestly felt invested during the waterfall fights, and I'll credit that to presentation over investment: they were simple scenes delivered with excellence.  Everyone should watch this because it's 
	
Storyline:  80
	I really did want this story to be better, and it has a good premise (even if that premise is actually a twist, and maybe that's the problem?) with a challenge to the throne by someone who is essentially an outsider, at least as far as the culture is concerned.  With the twist of Killmonger angling for the throne and basically being a black hitler, it was a lot to resolve at once and felt like a shake up when I felt like a foundation was still being built: and some people like that.
	
Character Development:  90
	I love that we got to see so much exposition about different characters and the previous iteration of the Black Panther, not to mention development of Wakanda itself.  Killmonger even has enough behind him that I wouldn't mind seeing him have his own movie.  Klaw has enough going on that he could be involved in that or have his own movie that crosses Killmonger's and Ultron's, but he's not really as strong a character.  T'hcalla himself feels like he's dragged into and through the character of the Black Panther, historically.  One of the most interesting parts of the Black Panther as a concept is looking at it as if the Black Panther is it's own (spiritual) character, even if we have to see T'Challa suffer and direct it.
	
Compulsion:  85
	I like the movie, just fine: it was good, well produced, had fun characters, but the level of hype behind this movie really left me wanting.  I was expecting something that was going to change paradigms and really knock my socks off, but it just didn't.  Not only did we do another Marvel mirror, we killed off 2 viable antagonists and forced focus away from Wakanda at the end of the movie.  Unless there is another movie that reveals the dead killmonger as a Skrull, I'll be disappointed in this as part of the problem with how Civil War is being delivered (and frankly overshadowed by Infinity War).
	
Final Score:  87.5
