Notes: Bright

Opens on grafitti and a weird "tour of the city"

Will smith is cop, with orc partner
	gets shot by shotgun
	
He wakes up and gets coffee from his wife (white)

There is a fairy pest

Wife sees the joe rogan podcast
	talking about his partner

he goes to kill the fairy
	"fairy lives don't matter today"
	
He beats the fairy to death with the broom
	
talking to daughter about racism
	orcs aren't dumb
	orc shows up
		Jakoby
		
Will immediately 180s on orc racisms
	Jakoby demonstrates orc smell ability

Ironically being more human is what is causing Jakoby issues on both sides
	
Will delivers his daughter, she breaks everyone's heart

Ward and Jakoby have a tense conversation
	Ward won't listen to orc music
	Berates him on the way
	
They drive through "elf town"
	demonstrates rich, proper elves
	
									This bullshit is LITTERED with analogies to the real world
									
In the locker room (unisex)
	Ward shifts to defend himself, AND Jakoby
	other cops think that Jakoby let an orc get away with a crime
	
Assignments
	woman makes a rapist joke
	Nick check under the desk for a bad guy
	
on patrol
	they roll through orc gang territory
	demonstrates orc strength and behavior
	demonstrates police brutality against orcs
	Ward challenges Jakoby about being a cop first, orc second
	
Guy with a sword
	humans laugh with each other while crazy guy swings sword
	guy finally throws down sword when they threaten to kill him
	We get to see how cops act towards humans and cops act towards each other.
	
In the car
	guy speaks orc about a prophecy
	
Garage
	Ward is hosing out the car and talks to IS
	IS wants Ward to record Jakoby incriminating himself
	Funny stereotype about orcs not being able to jump high
									this is in contrast to the analogy of orcs to blacks

Federal investigators show up (elf and human partners)
									this parallels / mirrors Jakoby and Ward

Ward and Jakoby have another tense car conversation

Feds interrogation
	"Shield of Light", agent shaves his head to show a tattoo
	"Magical Task Force"
	Talk about Brights, some even human
		Touch a wand and don't explode, lol

Shootout
	Jakoby makes a shootout awkward (only the holes that I was born with)
	Ward has to walk him through a shootout
	they waste a lot of ammo
	they were shooting blindly into a 2nd story
	investigating the building, they find a bunch of burned out bodies and a wall person
	find an elf and chase her
	turns out she has a wand
	she speaks elvish
	Jakoby took "2 years in highschool"
	Elf requests protection
	
Reinforcements show up and want to steal the wand
	Ward refuses
	There is a weird Alpha dog pack thing that happens with the other cops
	They give him an ultimatum about killing Jakoby and stealing the wand
	
	Ward agrees and goes out and pulls a gun on Jakoby
		they argue about his loyalty
		flashback on jakoby
			reminders about smelling
		cops mean to kill them both
		
	Ward asks Jakoby for sights and shoots all 4 cops
		idiot cop begs for his life
		
Poison shows up with a gang army
	stupid bullshit
	they're lucky to get away alive
	and shooting car chase
	"Butterfingers"
	taser shot from moving vehicle to moving vehicle
	Wand is bound to Inferni so the card literally hits a magic wall
	
Inferni shows up on the scene
	she kills the wall lady
	she kills the idiot cop
	her team moves on
	
Ward's team hides in a manequin warehouse
	Jakoby explains about the wand
	poison's crew finds them
	one guy touches the wand
	they all atomize
	
they go through some orc place kitchen
	they call Jakoby a traitor
	
Orcs at the club fight Poison's crew
	
Magic Task force lets us know that Inferni is vulnerable without the wand
	
War and Jakoby switch clothes
	not really going to work
	they go into a strip club?
	The elf likes the naked ladies
	Poison's crew bursts in
	
Right before the "titty bar gun fight die" starts
	the elves roll in and massacre Poison's crew
	unarmed, the elves kill all of them and some cops
	
Ward's team manages to run
	they talk about bullshit
	about orcs and humans
											it invoked a discussion of morality versus xenos
	
	
Ward calls the sherriff from the sword guy incident
	he comes out and they talk to the feds
	the Inferni listen in on the call
	phone dies
	Jakoby volunteers to be handcuffed, Ward gives up his weapon
	Sherrif is shot
	elf fight
											missed a bit, something about fire
	
Orcs take Ward and Jakoby
	Big speech from an orc from Miami
	They beat and torture Ward and Jakoby for the wand
	threaten the Elf
	wand isn't in the bag
	kill order
	boss's son, Mikey, is supposed to kill Jakoby
	Mikey is the guy Jakoby let go when Ward was shot
	Boss kills Jakoby
	Elf pulls the wand out of herself and resurrects him
	
The orcs let them go
	they all have a discussion in ENGLISH
	she needs to recover and tell them about the Inferni, servants of the Dark Lord
	the wall lady was an assassin that was let the wand by Layla
	
They get in the car and strategize
											they love to have conversations in the car

they get on site and Ward takes Jakoby's "big gun"
	Inferni are on site as well, hiding and observing
	then they break through the wall.....why?
	jakoby kicks their asses, sticks a bomb to the girl and throws her out a window
	ward blows her up
	dude keeps fighting
	Ward goes after Layla
	Layla takes at least 2 big rounds to the chest and a magic spell
	
Friendly elf is basically dying from magical corruption
	Ward takes her to the water to recooperate
	Layla starts glowing
	she shows up and hangs Jakoby
	kicks ward's ass
	pulls the elf out of the water
	big speeches
	Jakoby shoots the wand out of her hand
	Ward goes to touch the wand
		Of course, he's a bright
		he zaps Layla and tikka away
	Jakoby has to go back into the building for Ward
	The orcs show up and blood Jakoby
	
Jakoby and Ward have that shitty buddy cop moment where they still hate each other
	"fuck magic"
Hospital
	Magic task force shows up
	Jakoby spills everything
Medal ceremony
	tikka shows up, they get medals
