																I have opinions on this scenario
																comms team in building on border
																

Cabin
	they find different species of buds on the same plant
		as if the mutation set in as the plant was growing
			(different dna throughout the plant)
			
	girl gets grabbed and dragged into the house

	turns out it was a gator
										no it wasn't
		it breaks out of the cabin
		comes ashore
		chases them as they shoot at it
		
River
	for some reason they get in a boat to take the river south to the ocean
	
	they talk about themselves
		past lives
		
Forest Station
	they investigate
		obviously abandonded
		they drops bags to move about easier
		one finds a SAW machine gun
		
		one finds a schedule
			the building was a base of operations for one of the military teams
		
		one finds a "for those who follow"
			camera plays the media
				footage of her husband cutting away a person's stomach
					there is live, tube-like things moving inside him
					
	Pool

		weird stag deers
		
	Natalie finds Shepard eventually
		the other three just waited on her
		
Tables
	they find a place to rest
	there is a jungle gym
		and bushes that look like people
		
	they theorize
		they propose the Shimmer is a DNA refractor (like a prism)
			it's "bending" the DNA in the plants and themselves
			
House
	they set up camp in the house
	
	Natalie gets up late at night to look at her blood cells in a microscope
		they're splitting funny
		
	flashback
		Natalie remembers cheating on her husband
		
	Natalie wakes up to a rifle in her face
		other lady hits her with the rifle butt
		
	Natalie wakes up tied to a chair
		along with the other two girls
		
	Angry girl is upset....unclear
		about Natalie knowing her husband went into the Shimmer
		
		she's doubting Lena (Natalie) is telling the truth about a bear
		
		she's claiming she can see her finerprint moving
			she's afraid someone will tie her down and cut her open to see if her insides move
			
		a scream interrupts her carving up Lena
			she runs out, bad noises happen
			
	a "bear" walks in
		it makes noises that mimic it's victim's screams
		it slowly investigates the 3 ladies
		it starts to bite, finally
			angry girl comes in
				shoots up the room
					bear charges
						takes WAY too long to kill her
							instead of just biting
								it rips her jaw off
								
		the valkyrie (Josie) uses "full auto" to blow out it's brains
																it doesn't use the right sounds
																	sounds more like a helicopter mounted chain gun
																	
Outside
	they enjoy outside
	they reminence
		
	something is growing in Josie's arm
		she walks off
			Lena can't find her
			
	there is a whole community of plant people growing
	
Interrogation
	something, something, something
	
Woods
	Natalie is bawling
	
Beach
	Natalie makes it to the beach
	there are crystal growths all over
	even "trees"
		
"The Lighthouse"		
	there is a weird growth on the instead
	there is a weird hole in the ground
	there is a dead body
		that looks like he blew himself up on camera
		
	the video
		it's Kane taking footage of things for the record
			he thinks he might not be Kane
																is he something else after all?
																
			"my flesh moves like liquid"
			he's talking to a guy off camera
				tells him to go find Lena
				he burns himself with a phosphorous grenade
				other guy steps in frame
					her husband?
		
	she approaches the anus hole thing
		she climbs in
			and through
			
			she finds the blonde psychologist
			
The anus
	the psychologist is acting weird
		she had her face covered?
		then she didn't
		
	she suddenly starts vomiting .....light? stars?
	
	she...becomes....a sentient cloud
		with a portal
			Lena watches
				lots of shifting, converging DNA
		
	a "person" eventually forms
		Lena runs out the anus
		
	the "person" is waiting there
		it's blocking the door
		
	Lena grabs the tripod to attack
		it knocks her out
		then stands there
			until the scene cut
				then lays down next to her
					mimics her
						then humps her against the door
							at least pressing the air out of her
								she eventually passing out again
									it is mimicking her falling again
		
	she wakes up
		bleeding this time
	it mimics everything she does
		like a mirror
			so it looks aggressive
	

	Lena reaches for a phosphorous grenade
													it wouldn't BE there
														burned up
														
		it touches Lena
			it becomes her
		Lena gives it the grenade
			pulls the pin and runs
		it stand there
			starts to change back
			
		it does a lot of nothing for a bit
			confers with the dead guy
				then sort of run / crawls burning back to the anus basement
					which of course burns the lighthouse
						and the crystal trees fall
						
Interrogation
	she's ask to describe it's form
		is it carbon form?
		what did it want?
	she admits to attacking it
		not it attacking her
		
	she defends it
		it wasn't attacking everything
		it was changing everything
		
	she doesn't know much
														honestly, we don't either
														
														
														
Husband
	husband doesn't recognie her
		but they hug
		their eyes do a thing
														no answers
