	Before he goes to battle
		Kirito drops a ring to Asuna (marriage)
													let's be honest, shitty proposal
													
	Final Boss

		It whooops their asses
		it has a lot of shields
			even more health after that
			
		Asuna eventually joins the fight
			allows for everyone to rally
			
		Leafa joins
		Yui joins
			with "everyone" in tow
			
			Alfheim
			GGO
			Yui even loads their old SAO data
			and Sinon's GGO data

		this get's hiliarious in how anime it is

		Even the dead girl showed up from the Sleeping Knights

		They eventually beat it
			it drops a sword
			
			Kayaba speaks
				"Isn't there still something you need to do?"
				
	Kirito comes out as Rank 1
	
	Yuna begins to sing in "ghost" form
		it manages to reduce the "emotive" count
		
	The professor sees a vision of his daughter
	
	As all the monster's de-spawn
		the game data is being reset
	Yuna is being partially deleted
		she was based on part of the floor 100 boss

	Everything is appropriately sad as I would expect for SAO
