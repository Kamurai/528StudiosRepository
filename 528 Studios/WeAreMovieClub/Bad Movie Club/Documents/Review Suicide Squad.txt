Suicide Squad

Format: Live Action
Applicable Settings: Modern
Applicable Genres: Action, Comics, Science Fiction

Hit or Skip:  Skip!
	This is a poorly strung together mess.

General:
	To be fair, there are some good elements in here, but whatever is good is held together by wires so taunt they're about to snap.  I actually like Enchantress, I don't mind her brother, and the not-zombie army is a good premise.  Will Smith and Margot Robbie carry most of the movie, and Deadshot's not that interesting a character.  I think they tried to Avengers this shotgun wedding style and forgot they're dealing with villains, despite it coming up repeatedly.

Aesthetics:  90
	Look, they got some pretty people to do some things for us, and they pumped enough money into the production that it actually resulted in some good and very interesting CG and even practical layouts, like Harley's big ass cell.  Between Margot's portrayal of Harley and the Enchantress / Brother, that's where the bulk score is.  Then we have all the shitty dissapointing characters, especially Croc: who should be powerhouse behemoth, dreary boring atmosphere, and the worst Joker to date (someone has to be) is only slightly offset by how cold and evil Amanda Waller is.

Storyline:  30
	What is this story?  It's like someone saw the episode / issue where everyone was mad at Batman for having a contigency plan to kill Superman if he went rogue and the Suicide Squad comic and got confused.  Other than Diablo and Enchantress (who becomes the problem) non of these people are cut out for a frontal assault on supernatural entities.  This was probably a Flash movie with no Flash.  The misuse of these assets shows them as expendables when we had real soldiers to expend instead of baby sitting wards, especially when Deadshot was the only viable asset for most of the movie, and Waller feels the need to just shoot her team.  It may actually be a bigger travesty that they pull the mission off, than they were put on it in the first place.

Character Development:  25
	I feel like all the development that occured was over developed, or at least boring if not unimportant.  There were literally two sets of introductions AFTER we saw the 4 most important characers: Waller, Enchantress, Deadshot, and Harley.  Everyone else felt like they were tacked on and fairly meaningless as far as the movie is concerned.

Compulsion:  40
	I feel bad about it, but I actually have some fun with this train wreck of a movie.  Harley is wonderful, and this movie shows exactly how good of an actor Will Smith is with a lame part.  Enchantress is an interesting if odd villain, and Waller creates such a moral quandary that I think it's a day long discussion about morality and chracter roles in the waiting.  There is good here, trapped under a lot of garbage.  For a Change of Scene: I would have loved it if they had just started at the mission and if the mission would have been a more grounded, we just need people with guns that can die, type of thing.
	
Final Score:  46.25
