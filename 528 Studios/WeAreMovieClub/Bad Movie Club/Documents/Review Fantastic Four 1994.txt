#BadMovieClub  Review:
Fantastic Four (1994)

Format: Live Action
Applicable Settings: Modern (1990s)
Applicable Genres: Comics, Action, Science Fiction, SciFi

Hit or Skip:  Skip!
	I don't know what this is, but it took them a long time to do Marvel movies even close to correct.

General:
	I honestly don't know what happened with this movie, the writing is a little lacking, and even though we got "Monarch of Latvia" Doom, we also got Doom with no powers.

Aesthetics:  70
	For the time, the looks aren't terrible: The Thing looks like a Ninja Turtle, Johnny turns into a cartoon when he full flames on, the invisible technique could have been better, and The stretching is actually done pretty well.  The score is limited, but of good quality as well.  All that said, it's terrible dated and generally goofy.

Storyline:  50
	I don't know who thought this timeline / plotline was good, accurate to the comics or not.  It's ultimately complete, but we have to have 2 events just to make Reed 20-30 years older than his wife Sue, along with Doom, and he gets no powers as a result.  The entire Jeweller story arc seems filled with unnecessary moments, but they're forced to do things to achieve a goal when they should have changed goals.

Character Development:  30
	These characters are trash.  I'm not a Fantastic Four fan in general, but these are awful.  They go from garbage to super powered garbage and we get a poor presentation of Doom.

Compulsion:  20
	I don't know what I was looking at most of the movie.  The music helped save the movie for a while until I realized they used the same 4-5 songs.  Generally they failed to capture any of the fun in what could be a slap sticky Fantastic Four funtime.
	
Final Score:  42.5
