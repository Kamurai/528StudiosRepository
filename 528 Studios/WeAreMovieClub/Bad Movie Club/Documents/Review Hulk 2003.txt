Applicable Settings: Modern
Applicable Genres: Comics, Action, Science Fiction

Hit or Skip:  Skip!
	This is 2:20 of a long boring version of Hulk.

General:
	This movie is a great idea FILLED with problems, and I don't blame the director (Ang Lee), the actors, or even the writers.  I feel like this was back when they were still TRYING to make the MCU, but hadn't gotten the hang of doing a comic book movie seriously and possibly over corrected.  There is a really good movie in here, but I'm going to say the production directives noted this in some strange directions.

Aesthetics:  70
	While the tranformations between Bruce and the Hulk are very well done, it's the end result of Hulk that is problematic.  I don't even blame the cg engineers, it seems like the design just wasn't well established.  Seeing a 2 story Hulk that has to kneel to reach Betty is too big, especially since he's not even rage filled at the time.  The dogs are also well done as well, just awkwardly styled.  The movie stylization is design to represent what hollywood's perspective was of comics at the time.  When we finally get to them though, the actions scenes are actually fun to watch Hulk throw tanks and helicopters around.

Storyline:  65
	I actually don't think the story in this is so bad, it's just REALLY, REALLY long.  We can probably lose almost everything to do with Bruce as a child: all that information is reference or able to be inferred later in the movie.  There are also several developmental expositions that really aren't necessary: they don't add to the tension, and they don't really payoff into anything Hulk related later on in the movie.

Character Development:  40
	Ross' character denies every reasonable availability to grow into an actual person instead of a retarded hate machine afraid of his daughter being treated like a woman.  Even Talbot never changes from whatever spoil brat of a character he is, even in the face of death.  Betty learns to adjust to the reality of David and Bruce, but by being a statically loving person to Bruce.  David, despite being literally changed on the atomic level was always an over-ambitious sociopathic monster.  Bruce, despite the resistance, is the only character in this movie that truly changes who they are to adjust to his new persona, and that's only because he can't be rid of it.

Compulsion:  30
	Bored....so bored for so long, waiting for the bewilderment and relief of seeing Hulk fight giant dogs with green blood, and Hulk destroying military equipment on a large scale.
	
Final Score:  51.25
	There is a good movie to pull out of this footage, its just not easy to see.
