#BadMovieClub  Review: The Slashening
Format:  Live Action
Applicable Genres:  Horror

Hit or Skip:  Skip!

General:
	There was very little of value hear.  This feels like a imitation / mockery of Scream attempting to be meta about the ridiculousness of horror movie tropes.

Aesthetics:  50
	For a lot of bad horror movies like this, it is nice to be able to clearly see the movie and the characters.  Its nice to see attention to detail like lenses being removed from glasses.  That said, other than a few pratical effects, most of the movie looks completely average, not bad, just boring.  And, unusual for these types of movies, 5 girl characters and no nudity or actual sex involving them, but multiple (fake) penis shots.

Storyline:  60
	I would ding this alot more, but they actually picked alot of the right things from other movies to implicitly talk about during the movie.  The ridiculous nudity, girl on girl, cheating, murdering randos, gaming, head smashes, most of this movie is written in extremes to make points, even the double kilers.  It just doesn't do anyone of it well.

Character Development:  10
	If the vapid empty characters were supposed to mean something, I missed it.  Even the argumentative killers with different motives undermined intead of debated the point of slasher killers.

Compulsion:  20
	For a class on horror tropes, I could see this requiring some attention, but I honestly opened a game and started playing it, while taking notes and watching this.
	
Final Score:  35
	If you're going to watch this hot mess, at least watch it on Theater Mode or with enough friends to make jokes about it.
