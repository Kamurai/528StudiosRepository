#BadMovieClub  Review:
Zack and Miri Make a Porno

Format:  Live Action
Applicable Settings: Modern
Applicable Genres:  Comedy

Hit or Skip:  Hit!
	A delightful surprise.

General:
	It good to see Kevin Smith direct a "legitimate" cast, while I'm sure his usuals could handle this movie fine, there are certain aspects that help an audience accept a movie.  Unfortunately because of the subject matter and that the word "Porno" was in the title, the movie suffered a huge hit from its fractured marketing campaign alone.

Aesthetics:  85
	For a movie about making a porno, you would think it would be focused alot more on being sexy and actual sex.  With the parts that are about creating this pornography debut, the scenes are done real classy and surprisingly little nudity, where it didn't make logistic sense to cover her top up and Jason Mewes full naked in a non porn related capacity.

Storyline:  83
	The story feels really familiar; there's a good formula under it with a refreshing twist of pursuing porn to avoid financial doom.  The plot developing into romance on top of the complicated process of saving themselves helps gives the method some substance, but not realy enough to offset its own crude perspective.

Character Development:  83
	Granted they're the title characters, but Zack and Miri really feel like the only characters you can fully invest in.  The supporting characters do just that, they support, but they don't really grow on their own: just the same people in better scenarios.

Compulsion:  90
	There is a lot of good humor, and I can't gurantee that any one person will be laughing start to finish, but there something for someone every step of the way.  The variation in the humor, plot and scene construction really helps keeps the levity up along with its rewatchability.
	
	
Final Score:  85.25
