#BadMovieClub Review: Santa With Muscles

Hit or Skip:  Hit!

General:
	Note a great movie, but as far as bad movies go, this is rather fun.  Hogan actually shows a good range of acting sidled with some fantastical feats of strength.  Even if the premise isn't very strong, the movie remains fun despite itself.

Aesthetics:  60
	Let's be honest, for a movie filmed in the 1980's: it looks as bad as you would think.  Then layer on top of that Hulk Hogan acting stiff and goofy and ridiculous.  The saturday morning cartoon reject villains don't help: every time there is a scene that looks a little interesting there is an absurd character that takes me back out of it.  All said, seeing a very young Mila Kunis and watching Hogan's fight scenes are pretty entertaining.

Storyline:  60
	This is a weak premise that is so tropey that it hurts.  A bad guy stealing the orphanage for underground resources.  An amnesiac celebrity thinking he's Santa is a little novel, but his character quickly starts to work against it, reducing it to a simple lost identity scenario.  There were even a couple of deus ex moments in the movie to suddenly shift the story direction.

Character Development:  70
	Hogan's character goes through a decent transformation, the main villain gains the smallest amount of redeemability (even if it helps save himself), and the character of "Lenny" truly turns a leaf from serving himself to helping others.  These are really good traits, but they're 3 characters in a whole movie and fairly predictable how things progress.

Compulsion:  75
	Despite its many flaws, and dated time period, the movie is fun.  It great having Hulk Hogan think he's Santa Claus, it fun watching Lenny fail at being a greedy villain, the kids are cute and entertaining, the villains are laughable and there is a story to follow.  Its hard to say that one would truly enjoy this movie, but its still a fun movie to laught at if not with.

Final Score:  66.25
	A better of the bad movies.  Watch this if you want to laugh at the 1980's, or Hulk Hogan.
