#BadMovieClub  Review:
Red State

Format:  Live Action
Applicable Settings: Modern
Applicable Genres:  Action, Horror

Hit or Skip:  Hit!
	By far, the best Kevin Smith movie.

General:
	

Aesthetics:  90
	The delivery of dialogue, the atmosphere, the angle of the shots, whether during "sermon" or action are all spot on.  Even the jarring wrap-up at the end of the movie is well structured for 3 guys talking.

Storyline:  88
	This is a crazy plot that gets you questioning life, religion and morality.  If you're in the mindset to think about such things, then this provokes that fairly well.

Character Development:  88
	There's an overlying question of morality on both sides: the preacher and his family as well as the ATF contemplating their orders.

Compulsion:  90
	With the possible exception of the establishing scenes at the beginning of the movie, the movie is riveting.  The family is hunting and killing its fellow man and through a tragic accident of failure, the ATF of all things is sent in to handle a catastrophy.
	
Final Score:  85.25
