#BadMovieClub  Review:
Cop Out

Format:  Live Action
Applicable Settings: Modern
Applicable Genres:  Comedy, Action

Hit or Skip:  Skip!
	There are some genuine funny moments in this, but it's mostly your typical bullshit buddy cop movie.

General:
	If you like buddy cop movies, if you like somewhat crude humor, if you like Tracy Morgan's over the top comedic style, then give this a watch, otherwise watch your favorite buddy copy movie instead.

Aesthetics:  80
	There's just nothing special visually in this.  It's all produced very well, and Sean William Scott's scenes have great visual humor and dialogue, but it's not what grabs your attention.

Storyline:  70
	Ultimately the bullshit story is about a baseball card, of which we are reminded repeatedly.  Thankfullly Gabriella's story takes over and I can pretend that Tracy brought her home for him and Rashida Jones.

Character Development:  70
	For a character that is barely in the movie, Rashida Jones probably gets as much development as Tracy or Gabriella.  Bruce's character's expositional development is kind of forced into the story as a plot mechanic, and ultimately a weak punchline.

Compulsion:  85
	They best thing about this is that is has some funny, funny scenes in it.  Bruce and Tracy are good enough actors that they pull off the buddy cop thing like they've been doing it for years.  Sean William Scott really steals the comedic show with some insessent ranting of which I'm honestly quiete jealous.
	
Final Score:  76.25
