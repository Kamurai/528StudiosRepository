#BadMovieClub  Review:
Jersey Girl

Format:  Live Action
Applicable Settings: Modern
Applicable Genres:  Comedy

Hit or Skip:  Skip!
	This is a very particular roller coaster of sad to appreciatively happy.

General:
	While this is a movie that Kevin Smith bromantically wrote for Ben Affleck, it feels sort of like "Up!" with a slow burn on the beginning.  The first half of the movie really feels like its just too sad to work, but the only ones I can feel bad for is the baby and Grandpa.  I honestly don't feel much for Affleck or Lopez in this as their characters are nearly unredeemable.  Its the supporting cast that saves this one as Affleck is saddle with, from my perspective, a character that basically spends the movie emotionally abusing everyone else.

Aesthetics:  80
	The NYC skyline gets some great use and Smith's selection of New Jersey made me appreciate the garden state.  The majority of the movie is very common scenes, the most fantastical of which is Will Smith.  That said, the shots are lined up well and characters are positioned appropriate for the scenes.

Storyline:  70
	Maybe the problem is that its not a "traditional" romantic comedy where its about two people banging at the end (even if they do), but a love story between a daughter and her father, but I can't seeing many people taking to this story.  Even for myself, someone who does really like the movie, the amount of "oh yeah, dead mom" in the movie is a little much.

Character Development:  75
	It feels like there is only as much character development as is necessary for the plot, and unfortunately it's only enough to restore Ollie to level of generally acceptable human.

Compulsion:  80
	I enjoy this movie, its cute and its full of feels.  Unfortunately this movie is not going to wow anyone.
	
Final Score:  76.25
	There are better (Kevin Smith) movies to enjoy, in general.
