#BadMovieClub  Review:
Vulgar

Format:  Live Action
Applicable Settings: Modern
Applicable Genres:  Drama

Hit or Skip:  Skip!
	This is a rough, depressing movie.

General:
	Don't get me wrong, the movie is powerful in some of the worst ways and is an example of how to deal with bullying / crminals, but it is not uplifting.  This movie deals with some very heavy topics and is likely to trigger folks sensitive to rape and abuse.

Aesthetics:  70
	The movie is brutal with it's subject matter and definitely gets its point across, but without being overly graphic.  With the exception of the shootout and maybe his recovery scene, the isn't much about this movie that stands out visually.

Storyline:  85
	The idea of going through a trauma like this and confronting those that caused it is a fairly good basis for a story: so much so that I'm fairly certain it's a trope at this point.  You can see it in kids and bully movies, revenge plots, and even "I Spit on Your Grave".  Though adding an original twist to this trope does give the movie weight.

Character Development:  85
	William deals with problem after problem in this movie with little benefit other than the work and a bit of money, which is, in turn, threatened and becomes a problem in its own way.  Him growing a power of agency over his life and attempting to take control is a great way to end with the character, regardless of the actual result.

Compulsion:  51
	I actually like this movie, but it's dull and weird, and hard to follow at points.  The level of intensity is almost jarring between his abuse and the rest of the story, so much that I found the hostage scenario somewhat bland.
	
Final Score:  85.25
