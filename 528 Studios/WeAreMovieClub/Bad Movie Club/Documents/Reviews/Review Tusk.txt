Tusk

Format:  Live Action
Applicable Settings: Modern
Applicable Genres:  Horror

Hit or Skip:  Skip!
	This is a very niche movie, I can't truly recommend it to everyone.

General:
	For a movie based off a random story that got turned into a joke on a podcast, this is really good.  And that unsettling feeling that Walrus suit gives you is accurate: it's how you should feel about it, regardless of how goofy it looks.

Aesthetics:  88
	The walrus suit is fairly goofy looking, but it's equally unsettling.  What's more is that everyscene after Howard How breaks character is creepy as hell.

Storyline:  85
	The story is based in reality, but they took a dark twist on it, having it be a focus of a serial killer in Canada, of all places.  I think it's a great story, but some of the relationship points, and the oddity of the Quebecian private investigator sort of distracts from the main plot.

Character Development:  80
	The layers of the characters in this are awful, to the point where I don't think I care for anyone in this movie except the Private Investigator.  No one redeems themseleves: everyone is locked in their own destructive cycle until the end, and even after Wallace 'dies' he's been changed so much that he's a barely a shadow of himself.  The only real development is that people suck, or literal torture, but done well.

Compulsion:  88
		I honestly really enjoy the movie, but it's hard to watch with other people because it's hard to make fun of as a bad movie, but it's equally hard to praise as a good movie.  There are so many great aspects of this that go fuzzy when it's centered around one of the weirdest human movie experiments since the Human Centipede.
	
Final Score:  85.25
