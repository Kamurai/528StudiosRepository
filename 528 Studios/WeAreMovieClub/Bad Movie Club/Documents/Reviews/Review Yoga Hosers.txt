Hit or Skip:  Skip!
	Great to see the girls get their first movie as leads, but I can't say everyone is going to enjoy this.

General:
	It's been a while since I've had a movie experience so close to Scott Pilgrim, but if that got you excited, this is more of an homage than a directly stylized after the former.  This feels a little bit more modern and femine, like if Scott Pilgrim was 15 year old girl, but in 2016.

Aesthetics:  88
	The movie bounces back and forth between feeling like Degrassi, Clerks, and Scott Pilgrim, but remains immersive throughout the entire movie, despite the would be jarring video game status introductions for the major characters.  Even the weird music videos don't feel out place amongst the goofy dialogue and the bizaro Bratzie monsters.  While we could argue all day on the stylistic choice of the monsters (like we could in Tusk), it's fitting of the goofy feeling of the movie that they look as they do, but are also defeated by Yoga.

Storyline:  85
	For a "sequel", it's surprisingly unrelated to its prequel.  This franchise is similar to Cloverfield where the movie is definitely after the first, but just exists in the same universe.  The focus of the Collens' Yoga life style, let alone their use of it to defeat a nearly supernatural foe is ridiculous, but fits with the idea of the movie making you want to laugh.  The biggest contradiction in the movie so far is that it being Canada: the idea is that there are no serial killers, but now 2 have occurred, both in this part of Manitoba.

Character Development:  80
	The movie is surprisingly anti-thetical to actual development.  At best, the Colleens are learning to adapt to not having their phones.  They even use their identity of Yoga to handle the assault by wiener demons.

Compulsion:  88
	This may have amounted to a family bonding experience, performed in front of the world, but it is fun, it reminded me of other fun things without me just wanting to watch them instead (an amazing feat in itself).  It is goofy and fun, with an interesting villain plot, and if you're a fan of Kevin, Smith, Ralph Garmin, or their podcast "Hollywood Babble On" you're in for a real treat.
	
Final Score:  85.25
