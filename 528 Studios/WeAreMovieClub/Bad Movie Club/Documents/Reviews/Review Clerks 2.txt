#BadMovieClub  Review:
Clerks 2

Format:  Live Action
Applicable Settings: Modern
Applicable Genres:  Comedy

Hit or Skip:  Hit!
	Just a funny, rauchy comedy served up Kevin Smith style.

General:
	This is an enjoyable movie from start to finish, filled with tiny details that make the movie feel good.  And for Kevin Smith fans, this is a great call back to the movie that started it all, Clerks.

Aesthetics:  85
	As much as Smith has caught flak over the years for his camera work, this looks good.  There's even a lot of variation: a clever black and white scene, a go cart scene, a surprise music video, and a donkey show.  The drawback is that those are well timed beats for a movie that is mostly focused in or around a fast food restaraunt, and other than some clever dialogue, its a feat to make it look good consistently.

Storyline:  80
	The movie even admits that the plot is silly: Randall outright says that Dante in a lover's triangle makes no sense.  The bromantic aspects are much more reasonable, but slightly less compelling as they are about dudes that work at at fast food restaraunt that dream about working together at a convenience store.

Character Development:  88
	There is a surprising amount of self discovery throughout the movie.  Each character has a big focus point that changes in them be it love, pragmatism, ideology, or just some personal goals.  What's more, the characters feel worthy of investment.

Compulsion:  92
	This movie is a laugh a minute, with little downtime, and all of which furthers the plot, usually in an interesting fashion.  The actors commit to the absurdity of themselves and their situations and really make this a good time.
	
Final Score:  86.25
