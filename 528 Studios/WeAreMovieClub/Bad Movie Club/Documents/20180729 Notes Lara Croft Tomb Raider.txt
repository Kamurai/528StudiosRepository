House
	she goes to meet the ominous people from the grand hall
	
	he is upset she didn't bring the clock itself
	he word flirts with her about the object
	
Home
														any house that allows for two people to call across a foryae as if from between buildings is too damn big
														
	she does some bungee dancing
														too damn big
														
	some kind of troops move in on the house
	alarm goes off
		she hides in the chandelier
			immediately gets caught
				swings away to engage in hand to hand with suspended troops

	the english guy from the auction house is helping the ominous guys tear out a location
	
		they have a small army
		
	Lara is following a laughing child...

			and disappears
										honestly a little creepy
	Lara falls through the earth
		into a temple
		immediately breaks out a chem light that does nothing
		
		bad guys are coming
			she swings over to hide on a ledge
			
		they have about 2 minutes
		Lara transcribes a warning
			"touch anything and you get your head cut off"
			
		Dood figures out to put the swords in place
														I'm almost positive this would work like keys
															specific sword to specific hole
															
		Lara figures out about where to put the thing
		announces herself
			they shoot at her
			she explains
			they throw her the thing
			
			she's right
			
		"the log must pierce the urn"
			so she rides it to have it gain speed
				it pierces the urn
														no idea why this matters
														
					lots of crazy light
					
					a piece of the triangle floats up on what looks like liquid metal
					
		the liquid metal flows about the temple
			activates the stone monkey guardians
														really awkward guardians
														obviously not designed to handle guns
														
			flying dogs activate
			eventually the god statue activates (boss battle)
				it actually acts surprised about gunfire
					and concered about its eyes
					it goes for its swords
					it changes faces
					
		Lara acts like she's out of ammo even though they just showed off her crazy spinal ammo belt
			she uses the swinging log
			then literally cimbs over a winged dog / monkey / gargoyle thing
				which crumbles in the daylight
					everyone shoots at ther as she lands
						she runs into the jungle
							jumps off a waterfall to escape
							
							
	she rides a canoe into town

		calls her engineer

	she goes back in time to save english
		she turns the knife so the forward momentum caries it into the bad guy
			his troops abandon him
