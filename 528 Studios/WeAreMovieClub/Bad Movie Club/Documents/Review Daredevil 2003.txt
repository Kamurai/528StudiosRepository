#BadMovieClub  Review:
Daredevil (2003)

Format: Live Action
Applicable Settings: Modern
Applicable Genres: Comics, Action, SciFi, Science Fiction

Hit or Skip:  Hit!
	There's just enough here to make it worth it.

General:
	I still really like this movie despite it's alleged flaws, most of which were just restrictions on the available CG technology of the time.  Not only do Ben Affleck and Jennifer Garner do an excellent job with the action, but Michael Clark Duncan makes a surprisingly good Kingpin, and Colin Ferrell's Bullseye is probably my 2nd favorite villain behind Heath Ledger's Joker.

Aesthetics:  78
	There is some god awful cg in this, but they looked like they were trying really hard.  For the none-cg portions, the actors really bring the characters to life and give use some great action sequences, my favorite being the plain clothes fight on public playground.

Storyline:  85
	This is supposed to be an origin story crossed with a murder mystery story to discover who the Kingpin is.  With that in mind, there is shockingly little actual investigation or even interrogation that results in any leads.  The story hinges on a reporter's theory and a blabbermouth assassin, but it manages to wrap up the revenge plot nicely enough.

Character Development:  80
	It is a Daredevil movie, but there is LOT of expositional development not only on Matt, but his father.  It feels like we get next to nothing about Kingpin, except maybe how secret he is, and nothing about Elektra or her father.  For such a crazy  character, they manage to develope Bullseye the perfect amount.

Compulsion:  85
	I have a lot of fun with this movie.  Affleck and Favreau make a good buddy pair, the action is fun even when it's not great.  Bullseye is a fantastic villain and Michael Clark Duncan is dominating in every one of his scenes.  The most unbeliveable part of the movie was the romance, and the weight of irony is that Kevin Smith recommended Affleck for the role (even delaying Jersey Girl) which the resulting relationship with Garner would eventually cut Kevin out.
	
Final Score:  82
