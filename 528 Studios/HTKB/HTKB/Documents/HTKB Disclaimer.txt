The House That Kamurai Built YouTube videos are created with the purpose of entertainment, 
whether it be mine or others', and enlightenment through the discussion of intelligent 
concepts and opinions.

Anyone who is stupid, disagrees with me, and / or simply doesn't like my videos are 
welcome to not favorite, rate poorly, not subscribe, unsubscribe, or WATCH SOMETHING ELSE.

With that said, The House That Kamurai Built will not do the following annoying things:

1)  Ask you to subscribe, rate or favorite.
2)  Apologize for being late or not making videos.
3)  Claim we do not know what to say or discuss.
4)  Do "thank you"s in formats other than the following:

	a)  Giving credit where credit is due.
	b)  Special response videos, directed a particular person.
	c)  Commemorative "Thank You" videos, which you are welcome to ignore.

The House That Kamurai Built does encourage you to comment, discuss, respond, and most 
importantly, "Expand your mind.".

Thanks for making this world a better place, and Have a Nice Day!
