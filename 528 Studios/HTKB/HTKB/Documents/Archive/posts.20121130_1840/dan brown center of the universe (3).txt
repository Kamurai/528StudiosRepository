Your theory places Terra at the center of an environment defined by the furthest possible distance travelled by light by light since th"beginning" of the universerse. 

This would mean that  Terra is what is left after an object (most likely a star) emitted that first amount of light and has tansformed into a planet that revolves about the star Sol.

As Terra is in motion about Sol, your theory must be false unless the boundaries to the physical universe are revolving with Terra about Sol which would make Sol the center of the universe, which also revolves about something.

This also doesn't account for anything that might exist outside of the physical materials that comprised the Big Bang (energy, multiverses, i don't know what)
