	Scene 1:
		[Chef starts with bar back to camera.  She turns to show she's actually wearing an apron]
		Chef: 	"Welcome back!  I'm The Pervy Chef and today we're talking about making a simple veggie salad.
				People think that a salad has to be mostly lettuce. [Chef throws up lettuce leaves]
				But there are so many good options to make a salad tasty. [Chef winks]
				[Chef brings up each item, stroking it seductively, almost longingly]
				Carrots, Cucumbers... and even Eggplants!" [swap vegetables as appropriate]
				[Chef takes an extra long pause and look at the eggplant, gulps]
				"Anyways!" [puts down the eggplant]
				"You want to make sure all your ingredients are well cleaned.  Food prep isn't time to get dirty!" [Chef winks]
				
				"Now you want to " [Picks up the cucumber] "make sure that you clean it extra good. [Chef runs some water over the cucumer, so it shines] You want make sure [Chef starts stroking the Cumcumber like a cock, rotating around the Cucumber with her wrist, but almost as if she's struggling with it] that you get all the dirty out of the details...[she trails off, sort of distracted by stroking the cucumber] [whispered] "...oh god..."
				
				"Once you get it nice and clean, you can test it, by...by, [laughing] tasting it, [more whispered, and staring down the cucumber] right?" [embarrassed smile back to the camera]
				
				[long longing look at the cucumber as she keeps stroking it and slowing bring it forwards to her lips, biting and licking her lips as it approaches.  Tongue out she swallows the tip, sucking the cucumber.]
				
				"It's been so long..." [biting her lip.  Chef swings her head to look guiltyly at the camera]
				
				[she puts her hand up to her mouth, giggles]
				
				"It's just been so long and..." [she looks down, then to the cucumber, then excited back at the camera]  I have an idea!"  [she hurriedly gathers up some of the vegetables and grabs the vegetable oil]
		
		[This would be a great point to cut the video and put it on somewhere like Youtube for advertising, if nothing else]
		
		[At this point, the Chef either transitions the camera to the kitchen floor or a bedroom (which would require laying out a protective layer such as a tarp or plastic sheet(s))]
